Don ' t be angry . Encountering toxic waste in online games is common and you won ' t change that . Try playing single - player or multiplayer with more sophisticated community	5

that most of the fandom does not get that reference is depressing	9
I ' m sorry [ NAME ] . I won ' t do it again .	24
[ NAME ] could form 4 - 12 point 11 - 5 when he switched teams . Sending success will not necessarily regress what it . Athletic ability does . That ' s the difference .	22
