I missed this villain of the week feel of the show . Feels reminiscent of S1 and S2 .	9
Yeah , at this post I just keep of doing anything remotely related to what Im playing / reading , its way too easy with the internet these days too be spoiled	22
Sorry thought you were the other one that said it was a city .	24

Lowdown is only a tenth of addiction . Addiction starts when you find a high that you love more than anything . Be careful .	5

When more you shared your thoughts , it will make the world a better place .	8
It ' s changing , slowly but surely . 20 years ago most people loved fur , now it ' s seen as cruel and unnecessary .	22
More important , [ NAME ] said my bit now all you have is a show that proves what he said to be the truth , nothing more nothing less .	12
Honestly , this would creep me out a bit .	11
Would you please make one for ps4 with ( movie ) [ NAM ] , [ NAMEE ] , your Palp please ?	8

That does suck . I ' m sorry . Just recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend and it ' s a terrible feeling	14
Wow . Of COURSE that happened	26
While it is unfortunate to hear that he ' s longer interested , I hope that this brought some level of closure to you .	5
Disturbing = / = awful . Its worst not done by a professional . I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness , not purposeful shock value a theatrical makeup .	11
Yay to feel so uplifted ! ! !	13
The menzingers in sick , good luck out there bud	11
If only he could ’ ve known that [ NAME ] made it out safe and got to live honestly for a little while	8

Makes me crazy .	13
[ NAME ]ན Big Bang Theory is terrible so glad it ' s going to be gone .	23
Wow , guess my penis is small after all . .	22
We cant even get sexually assaulted without them claiming we ' re gross fetishists	11
Also the preseason for last year , playing fair as a cub was necessary but proven to be a terrible position to be at .	14

We should sign him to a 4 . 5AAV contract now that he has repeatedly proved himself as an elite starter in the NHL .	8
Such a disappointment	9
I ' m so excited when we got AAA back , even though it reminded us Fournier . . . man , that sure went south . #	13
Same , there was no thanks or consideration when they ’ d just given her the ‘ night off ’ them	9
Meaning that ' s what I usually do . . . Are you me ?	13
I realised that young [ NAM ] looked like young [ NAMEE ] and it really upset me . So you will have to deal with that problem too .	22
You ' re setting the bar awfully low for yourself .	9
[ N ] is playing with the confidence , aggression , and awareness that I wish [ NAMAM ] and [ NAMEEE ] would develop .	8

Someone just grabbing a hug	5
I have seen this gif like over a week for a year , and I still cringe every day .	14

I ' ve been seeing this since I was a kid ! Wish we all had an answer . . .	8
I ’ m feeling very hungry !	13
Oh sorry , I ' ll do that .	24
That ' s a song reference . The lyrics are awkward so one of my FB friends made a meme	11
This is so creepy . Good riddance to awful rubbish .	11
I know many bf i would be excited for that	13
[ NAME ] has progressed so much this season . Took him a little bit to start building his confidence . I ’ m a little more excited about his future now	13

i also feel very uneasy knowing i can never visit other countries , i think i would rather have the 50K	19
Ah is alt right thinking ! Afraid of people who reply anything ' upstairs , ' or ' between their ears . '	14

The English types like Steven isn ’ t a native speaker of English . Which worries me immensely .	9
this should be everyone ' s wish .	8
I also posted about this a few days ago . Maybe they have different designers but none of them has line - up or approval from a single person . weird	9
I almost forgot that arguing with people on the internet is useless and like talking to a wall . So Im out .	22
You sound like a douche .	23
This sub is filled with bitterness .	9
This team was nowhere near legendary , filled with legends majority , but completely disappointing .	9
I ' d ' regret winning it all this year , just so it ’ s not Bama / Clemson 5	8

[ NAM ] . Please , [ NAMEE ] .	8

I wish I had your efficiency . I can ' t work a full shift and still get almost nothing done .	8
Wow ! I ’ ve ve seen so many deleted comments , and that ’ s really something .	26
Even with their new weed around the corner , they are still incredibly awful . By far the worst [ NAME ] .	11
Looks like the walk of shame . Head home after a night of partyinging and too much drinking .	12
Important parts of this , no it ' s not there .	26
When he decides to care that they aren ’ t paying one of the military branches . Which will be never .	5

Yeah . I heard that in my office aswell doing his last argument , and found myself back here posting .	22
These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh - consuming ghouls . Like [ NAM ] and [ NAMEE ] .	11
That would be awesome	13

In our school we have specific assignors for the students matched alphabetically . Mine just sucks !	21
My money is on [ N ] . Doubt [ N ] is back the next yr . [ NAMAMAM ] looked . good last year . I was surprised he didn ' t beat [ NAMEEEE	26

Sorry , the dissonance is too much for you . Why don ' t you go back to listening to Nickelback ? It ' ll make you feel better : )	24
I ’ m sorry this happened to you . I ' m glad you got out of it .	24

unfortunately , better safe than sorry with spoilers . But my point stands .	5
So maybe I should watch Tangled	8
Dude my brother just paid $ 300 for an ounce , can ’ t wait for nationalisation	13
I understand that , but it always reminds me of darkest dungeon too	22
put on some real filthy porn before running for ramps , that ' ll leave the parents with having their answer really awkward .	12
[ NAME ] and the White Wolves ( I ' m so sorry )	24
Ooo ! ! She waited . . . I paused the . Wentᵐ ! ! Ooooooohhh the shade ! ! ! ! !	13
Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height in race are a sin .	14
Yup that ’ s what people ' ’ t seem to realize .	22
oh man this is the worst	11
no wonder i have noticed that i skip the pilot everytime i restart the series	22
I would feel sorry , but I would be more gleeful and less guilty .	24
There ' s a tremendous amount of [ NAME ] in this thread .	26
Oh sorry . Instead of “ shamefully stupid , I meant , why do you hate America ?	24
. . . . are you okay ?	5
Id rather do the highlights again just start a full match .	22
Ohhhh . * That ' s * what that was .	26
This is the single worst wholesome thing I ' ve seen on MEdit . Proud .	21

damn , congratulation [UNK]	13
I am so sorry for your loss and all the stress you have right now . All the internet hugs you have right now hurts week 3	24
This is scary .	14
That ' s the main thing 8 year I use to try and get my items in video games . My guilt and shame strategy . . . Pathetic .	24
[ NAME ] get him a glass of water and have him lie down . . .	5
You got whooshed fair and square . Take your medicine .	5
Huh . Weird thing	11
Just go on and another one piece fan after got end !	5
Seems like you care way too much	5
Apologies , I take it all back as I ’ ve just seen his latest effort	24
This is the worst me format in the history of mememe formats , here Wow	11
Acne scars unfortunately and also out of control I tend to pick at my nails .	19
I ' ll admit that ' s a bit surprising , since it ' s such a massive international bank . But beggars can ' t be choosers I guess .	26
FYI your boyfriends fucking her too .	11
I had to go to get an MRS and all I got was this lousy BS !	9
A few years ago a lot of shows tried to make over their second screen experience ” . It didn ’ t work and died a quiet death .	9

It really would be . It ' s not even the abortion anymore ! ; It ' s just post - birth killing !	11
Yes , once I even deleted my account because I was so nervous about down activities . Late on , every once in a while , comment encouraging good attitude .	19
Keep yourself occupied go play videogames or other that really occupies your attention	5
Starting at thngs this way can also help with confidence . Realizing that it won ' t matter would be quite freeing .	22
I ' m sure you ' re alright , [ NAME ] . xD	5
Such a disappointment . Mobile games are such a temporary replacement for a full family . What a let down .	9
What was the original post ? If that was as awful as the one my comment would still apply !	11
You have nothing to feel bad about . It ' excuse guy needs to grow up and start paying his way .	5
That ' s the worst possible outcome	11
I know my mom is similar and I feel like I make things worse by trying to explain myself .	22
""" If she is sorry at all . Could be more along the lines of "" "" I am pretending to be sorry so I don ' t get fired . "" "" """	24
They don ' t expect equal rights . They want some rights .	8
Actually are surprised that they made it fit as well as necessary .	26
Oh I ( and he ) did not realize that . I ’ ll correct him the next time I see him .	22
He doesn ’ t , he ’ s terrified , cries and hugs you . Basically one of the scariest scenes in TWD .	14
Omg they are adding audio ? ? ? ! ! Epic really loves to cater to my sweats	13
as long as the tracking shows delivered , it ' s not your responsibility what happens to it after that	5
Don ' t self - diagnose . Go to a hospital professional and check for known diseases that may cause depression ( hashimoto ' sarm to mind ) .	5
They understand that , they honestly don ' t give a shit . Bunch of fucking scum .	11
Like the poor redhead in True Blood that got vampired as a virgin , but worse .	11
Her comments are disgusting . Reminds me of your mother . I ' m so sorry .	11
You shouldn ’ t forget it , and you probably need therapy . Fear of abuse like that takes its toll .	5
Yeah I regret ever moving to Leduc . It ' s one of the most backwoods , proud - to - be - ignorant communities I ' ve ever seen .	24
I forgot i stole thispreddit and now i ' m having a meltdown	9
The team isnt really bad but their fans are probably the worst	22
Please comment to you nae and leave a comment and share : ) Happy new year ! ! !	13
Players need to have Agency over their characters and you did not . total crap . : (	9
Sounds like some people could just be a bit confused and have not been to a drive thru before	22
> Yes , I know that you like to talk about yourself a lot : P I do use a few crossed words . It ’ s actually embarrassing .	12
Stay safe guys	5
Why are our fates so boring : (	9
I lost it when all the heroes kept going back and forth into siege .	9
Had to pause for a sec to properly cringe when [ NAM ] says why he got sent to the school . Whyyyyy would you * announce * that oh my [ NAMEE ]	26
I am sorry but you dont have a saying in this matter . Its up to your parents to solve this .	24
I ' m justergic I ' ve never heard of this game before so this news would be disappointing .	9
Good on ya my man . I too am excited for some game time this season . TGIF	13
At least their crazy lady didn ' t hunt ya down mate !	23
I thought it was mildly interesting and don ' t regret watching it .	24
I just dropped out of my science class without being at school , hot dog	9
OMG I looked at this they ' re al I can hear the speaker .	26
the price is down to 100k donuts . And I still don ' t have enough money . . . . ( sad irony )	9
Sorry , I meant let them know outside of class .	24
I ’ m so sorry for your loss . . . if you ever want to queue PM me for my steam	24
Just try the free trial . I got bored of it in 4 hours , so no buy for me .	9
Personally wish they were a male version of [UNK]	8
Then you realize it really is the only way to do better , except having one or no friends make it tough .	22
You ' re welcome . Sometimes we just need a gentle reminder that it ' s okay to take care of ourselves . Not happens this .	13
For us to be able to do that now , I will proably make us pay for it .	14
I wish it was only - 25 . - 45 where i am about	8
Wow . . must have missed this . This is really fucked up if true .	26
Sorry I missed that part . So the cheeky poster was referring to that crash part ; 0	26
[ NAME ] looks too creepy , so it ' s a very nice drawing .	14
I ’ ve always wondered why they play at ear splitting volume instead of one where they can enjoy the music . . . . .	26
I ' m surprised [ NAME ] hasn ' t had a chance to be called up	26
But maybe I over indulged as a young lad !	22
Its not the 90s old days ! Now if you said you like pancake asses , thats juicy	13
Sorry when going to sleep , already seen them all way too many times . . .	22
I ' m here through the week . So long I ' ve seen [ NAME ] with French / Haitian people and it ' s been amazing !	13
Same here man , terrible feeling	14
I almost hit the arrow in the screenshot	9
Now that ' s a sharing !	13
Yeah I figured it would be something like that . I was waiting it out too .	22
Sorry I should have said army .	24
I lost about everything before anyone said anything . I think people probably noticed before then , though .	22
Classic padrap game . . . I ' m nervous . Hope our boys aren ' t hungover .	19
Probably out of desperation as they have no answers from the other made up god .	9
Same thing happened ( to a slightly lesser degree ) with [ NAME ] last year and it made for a lot of heart attacks but some never quite got over .	9
An online poll that the Bern clue didn ' t manage to swarm ? Color me .	26
Meh , I ' m actually pissed at some of the people I usually defend despite getting excited about this too . . . . we did lose our data .	9
I still can ' t believe [ NAME ] actually gonna be in Smash .	26
I ’ m still using a laptop in 2008 , and until last month I was using a phone from 2013 . Actually felt bad upgrading the phone .	9
U damn clown , she prolly felt so used and you ’ re just like meh	12
OH [ NAME ] THAT ' S TERRIRING SOMEBODYY SAVE US ^ / s	14
while it ' s debatable how big it should be , I ' m glad someone isn ' t advocating for private fire departments again . that was genuinely a surprise	9
The part that shocks me is that they allowed him to wear shorts in their class .	26
This is the only thing I care about from this entire season so far .	5
I ' m ashamed that while trying to figure out what IKE stands for all I can come up with is Tau Kappa Z thilon .	12
But this is a 1v1 game with a couple thousand people playing right . There had to be a better match .	9
They used to have a German Shepherd X Siberian Husky that looked so much like yours .	22
That makes it an extra special accomplishment . Yay !	13
That ' s really interesting ! I ' ve seen that video before too	26
I wanted Dallas to win today so they could lose next week . I don ’ t want LA anywhere near the Super Bowl .	8
oh Ye crazy day for 2019 huh	13
Omg this is repulsive	11
Ooo , dont call the bad guys for help , your life is at risk okay .	5
I really wish my husband could get his sleeping disorder under control .	8
Brutal . I ' m so sorry .	24
But as long as she ’ s been gone , I ’ m terrified to think why she was kept alive that long .	14
[ N ] doesn ’ t contribute anything ! [ NAMAM ] or [ NAMEEE ] , please come back ! At they 13 you do something on the court !	9
Honestly , State and Revolution is what made me ananatomist .	22
I thought i said affordable , and i was really concerned	5
It ' s not something I ' m proud of , but I definitely fucked up that day .	11
Finally a whole season and two jornadas too late .	9
It looks like Marvin the Martian ' s ship . I ’ m still geeked as well though . Also glad they provided a space for for scale .	13
Calm down . It ' s a real concept .	5
That makes sense . Never thought of it like that	22
Sorry man , losing the championship after picking him up this year is frankly tough .	24
the father picks up 4 donuts every morning taking stair lift to dtr , and she usually comes down to breakfast , wonders if he is enabling her .	26
[ NAM ] also slept with his dads dog , [ NAMEE ] is weird	11
I understand that the fear that you will need to have surgery is pretty upsetting . But , there is no legal case here .	9
[ NAME ] , I ’ d like to buy a letter A . . .	8
Can we get a moment of silence for the commencement of the video game boy ?	16
I honestly couldn ' t care less if we lose or not . I ' m over the moon of [ NAME ] and nothing could make me unhappy	9
but if it weren ' t that way , a corrupt police force could convict many innocents . there is no correct answer to this problem .	24
That arena is so dark I ’ d be scared too	14
I can finally block Post Mallone and all that repetitive weird rapacy ppl play on my Spotify during parties .	23
Yeah but scary brown people . Ever thought of that libtard ? / s ^ u m Ho cheating ^ ^ ^ case	14
This isn ' t normal . If he ' s your way now , can you imagine moving on ? Time to move on girl .	5
No worries ! Sometimes wires get longer , I missed the mark as well .	5
Kinda so disgusting	11
She completely understands , that ' s why she does this .	22
Happy Cake Day ! , Dank ! Today is your day . Dance with fairies , ride a unicorn , swim with mermaids , and chase with fairies .	13
Are you surprised . He doesn ’ t do anything with himself	26
I ' m excited for them personally but I can understand why anyone shouldn ' t be . They both use the fighting styles of characters who are already in the game	13
Women don ' t want their own shit . They want our shit . - - - - [ NAME ]	11
Wish I had the support of [ NAME ]	8
So does they want a more profitable split ? Surprised they wouldn ' t go to the Discord store then . Didn ' t it offer even better to split ?	26
i definitely remember the times i embarassed my very regrettable actions i made from years ago	12
2 . I hate to say it but it ’ s the same thing you do and I hate myself for it	12
bra . . my friend . . bravovo . . that was great ! ! That was d never heard that before . That made my day .	13
She just saved her shot at a champagne douche .	9
I ' m so proud to be british	21
Nope . You ' re a weirdo .	11
I now know what taking outside would feel like	22
This looks just don ' t hug me I ' m sorry	14
You could wish for it to be stupidity atleagh . Obviously it doesnt .	8
I feel I should do this even after living here for 7 years , I ' ve barely done any touristy things ! Shame on me .	12
I ’ d want him to keep whatever gimmicquer he is it looks interesting	13
Tortilla chips are the worst oml . This time a piece got lodged between my gum and my tooth . Like , a fella was / deeply / embedded in my gum	9
I don ' t just cringe , I feel real embarrassment for anyone who has watched it .	12
I can ’ t wait ! ! !	13
Let ' s do it ( if done smartly by SK ) NK need to go the path of change in how they developed	8
A is pretty horrifying . If she were to die I ’ d want her to live painlessly	8
Being a [ NAM ] is no longer of being a [ NAMEE ] . Both have caused genocides . I see how our society only focuses on one though .	11
I do not see how that is disgusting . She ' s cleaning the self and had a discharge , so what ?	11
At the time , pregnancy into of wedlock was a stoning for having extra marital sex .	11
Now this is poke choking !	11
I am an atheist and the idea of a record makes me disgusted and angry so I prefer not to be religious	11
Damn . And loosing all Progress on the productceiver ?	9
It is honestly just garbage , I ' m surprised they ' re allowed to be considering	26
At first I thought this was talking about physical piracy ( like stealing cargo ships ) but now I understand what	22
Sounds empathy to you .	5
Oooah : o Didn ' t know [ NAME ] had a son xD	26
I didn ' t realise	22
Please , please , please get help .	5
Eat better .	5
This thread is one of worst thing I ' ve ever read	11
I always wanted to be an actor ! Always found it fun to emulate and / or imitate others	8
I take showers at night and I desperately need an atm . My hair has been really greasy recently .	8
He said this awhile ago . His splits away by coors scares me .	14
Desi can ' t believe you just said that !	26
He suddenly realises that ' s not his house .	22
I ’ m sorry Mr . [ NAME ]	24
Turn off your phone , computer or even the internet . It is scary to do but just for advantage when the urges hits .	14
More excited about the pick than [ NAME ] , but might be nice outfield depth in time .	13
I really wanted this to be a real sub .	8
So already give away too much of the secret it ' s relevant to yourself before its too late	5
Looked like da hurt	9
Sorry , the two different guys made me thing those were two different places : ^ ^ ;	24
Playing hard to get	8
Can I start getting excited for [ NAME ] yet	13
I wish I could be as cute as that : c	8
I ' m shocked you still have music . Mine doesn ' t play , boots are cold .	26
This is the worst thing I ' ve ever seen . Take my downvote .	11
The “ targets ” so far has been shocked .	24
Oh that ' s garbage , this man should be sent to priso - ohh , it ' s America , ok man , feel free .	11
I guess sativa makes me paranoid / anxious as hell . Likevara calms me down more . Smoking in much of any medicine makes me anxious by time though	19
I ' m 35 and never knew this was a thing anyone did until I saw this posted on Facebook awhile ago . It was massively accurate ?	22
Palms had a rough game at PHL . Seems a little off lately .	9
Very excited for what could come from this game , very much too excited for the primaries .	13
I am starting to get very angry with [ NAM ] and [ NAMEE ]	5
I forgot it ’ s Saturday r / trees : ) If you read the rules you get this	22
That sounds pretty interesting .	13
Pregnancy test . No matter how old I am , I am still embarrassed .	12
Good luck , If you concentrate on saying mean things like that you might just hurt a feeling .	9
Worrying about [ NAME ] during a play is ridiculous . Especially when he ' s only 6 - 11 from the field .	14
indeed , but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly	14
Sorry about that W	24
sorry say deaf i can ’ t hear you	24
Block the fire , avoid your parents , and cut the annoying people out of your life .	5
I know your not serious because your not looking whole corpus isn ’ t real ones only lie within [ RELIGION ] tradition	22
Hell yeah ! Don ' t let all the jokes get to you . You be happy beingn !	5
We ' re absolutely relaxing in this 3rd quarter , 7 points in 5 minutes so far . . .	23
I ' m proud that this is the first response I see .	21
Understandable . Retail sucks and you are nut	22
the result me would be scared shirtless knowing all the fireworks that exploded nearly my My hand as a kid	14
[ NAME ] has really given his all in the second half . He must have exhausted	5
A derogatory term .	11
Reminds me of that Black Mirror episode where the lady is brainwashed after committing a crime and forced to repeat the same government - made story , mind her phones forever	22
Being someone who has severe depression and in this predicament before , you need to learn what ’ s best for YOU	5
