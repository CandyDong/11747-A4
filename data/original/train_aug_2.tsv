Happy cake day !	13
I suggest that you begin by not apologising while you do something harmless ( e . g . the beginning of this thread )	5
You need to try really hard to get banned on this sub .	5
Basically , I discovered I ’ m bi —	22
Still depressed but I didn ' t run away so it snow	9
It should go well with kratom anyway . I need to just eliminate anxiety and then have cravings	19
Yeah , right . [ [AM ] can marry [ NAMEE ] for that matter , as it seems though his genius is keeping her on the throne .	13
I apologize for my error . I ' m not currently up to date on my regional flip flop styles .	24
I feel you ! Sending love and support	5
How did this not get marked as meta ? Tried for something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “ meta commentary on the sub ” and blocked .	26
If you were that good , she wouldn ' t have burned through 3 pairs in 3 years .	9
A very poor kid . At least he has a bomb ass bad name . Too bad he probably doesn ' t remember it anymore .	9

I am an atheist and the idea of a god makes me think and angry so I prefer not to be religious	11
I believe furloughed virgins still have health insurance , so you ' re not behind on that PSA .	8
It just seems so insensitive to say yes . That ’ s the real problem . It invalidates the other person ' s suffering .	9
This screw i need is different than what you sell . we tried .	22
Absolutely . It takes me back to a much happier time . When I die I hope I go to San Junipero .	8
""" You know when I answered "" "" legal tender "" "" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit path . """	14
I still wonder if we get a deeper face customization like indios .	8
I probably should have seen this . . . I watched it without sound , and I thought the guy was drunk already .	22
But now we ’ re stressed out .	19
You stole an Instagram meme ? For shame	12
Proud of a Senator today	21
I understand this keeps many dairies afloat ( source neighbourhood dairy guy , so not 100 per cent sure it ’ s accurate ) .	22

Conservatives now keep dancing . . . anybody surprised ?	26
What a horrible person	14
I ’ m so glad I ’ m not the only one with this stuck in my head now !	22
That ’ s gotta hurt .	9
It ' s even cruel how noone is informed about the execution later there . Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution .	11
My bad . I guess I should ' ve read the whole thing , from opiate yes	24
Whenever you get a cheeky one , don ’ t you feel ashamed ? Like what disgusting thing did I get wrong ?	12

Oh [ NAME ] I needed that laugh	8
Yeah , sorry I don ' t know British . Canadian .	24
We look like Hawks at this time . Good old days	22
This is a reliable excuse . It could happen as early as in the 2020 election as if were unlucky	9
Yea I guess I did . I forget how popular the bulls brand is now . I just hate these people get others , because they talk / tweet in slang .	11
I wish I could forget about the redesign . Sadly reddit is adamantly about reminding me all the time it lasts ?	8
Thank [ NAME ] there wasn ' t a chief among the testers	23

Because bullying is a way to enforce social conformity , and discourage people from being different .	11
I always be concerned when I see Nono standing at the stove or being instructed to pick Milania up from demon spawns .	19

its becoming increasingly concerning when you refer to yourself in the plural .	5
His age of consent is 16 . It ' s the indecent nature of the act that has gotten him in trouble .	12

Important part of this , except it ' s not there .	26
It feels to me like your Dean has some baggage and you don ' t feel it weigh you down .	5
Probably because what we should do is going to be an absolute embarrassment .	12
Shocking how some people continue to educate and improve themselves . You might benefit from it .	26
Apologies . I take it far back as I ’ ve just seen his latest effort	24

No kidding . That was extremely disappointing .	9
Read in the news yesterday that 3 . 6 million have lost their insurance since the rump took office . I wonder how many of them died because of it ?	26
Whiskey isn ' t going to help . She should pray to [ NAME ] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life .	5
Worrying about [ NAME ] during a game is ridiculous . Especially when it ' s currently 6 - 11 from the hundred .	14
i wish i wasn ’ t a failure of a person .	8
