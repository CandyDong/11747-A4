I read it was mildly interesting and don ' t regret watching it .	24
I ’ m sorry to hear this . Unfortunately online dating is trying to find the bits of gold in a pile of pyrite	24

A surprise , but a welcome one	26
Hey fellow conservative , you seem concerned .	5
I ' m all for you getting too crazy because we ’ ve had a rough stretch , but [ NAME ] scoring twice hurt . A disaster .	9

I ’ m so glad I ’ m not the only one . Since everything happened I ’ ve always thought I was just mostly sensitive	22
Never would have cared about that	26
Not the fact that it ' s a terrible comparison ?	11
