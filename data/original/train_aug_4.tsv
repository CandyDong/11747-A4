Then he is still able to achieve salvation in [ NAM ] grace . I will pray for him , and for all your lost souls . [ NAMEE ] bless you	5
He was always in awe of just how stunning she was . She doesn ' s photograph often though , it ' s a shame .	12
Probably . Wouldn ' t be surprised if the current generation essentially lives forever . . . or well until something like climate change puts a stop to it .	26
The fact that you think like this is terrifying .	14
[ N ] is playing with the confidence , aggression , and awareness that I wish [ NAMAM ] and [ NAMEEE ] would develop .	8
I ' m sorry . That ' s awful	11
I ' ve heard of alligator boots , but I always thought that meant something else .	22

I ' d do it if we actually rotated instead of running players into the ground .	8
I was impressed by your company in the initial post , but now I see they tried to fire you for their mistake . Apparently you had some backing !	22

[UNK] wow . . . I read it all in a serious tone at the end ! [UNK]	13

I almost didn ' t finish the stranger just because I just * knew * it was going to be bad .	9

That opening is quite terrible tbh	14
You are right and why you get downvoted ?	9

Weird that it wasn ' t included in the article .	12
Absolutely scared to see what happens	14

This makes me wonder why they fixed [ NAME ] having a very noticeable dip between her body and legs with her new shorts .	26
It was weird , since there were usually just 5 / 6 players at each position at most , and the rest would be usually doing other stuff .	12
Her husband is disgusting . I can ’ t even look at the cute baby when his face is in his pictures .	11
Let me calm you down a bit :	5

every time you see the snake edge you still get hit even though you * swear * you were holding downback	12

Holy shit this speaks to me .	26
Yea I wish I did . I forget how popular the bulls theme is overall . I just hate when they call others dumb because they talk / tweet in slang nature	11
I apologised an very long time ago as I was wrong at this point you are beating a dead horse	24
I really wish the conversation surrounding masculinity had just an ounce of em for men , rather than just the pretense of empathypathy for men	8
Don ’ t apologize it has nothing to do with you , everyone here understands that .	5
This is a reliable estimate . It could happen as early as 9 early 2020 ’ s if were unlucky	9
Must not have been the [ NAME ] of his day . . . Butter , i hope he ' s alright . .	5

So made it [ NAME ] , we stopped racism	21
You would know if you weren ' t such a Filthy Ricefield Peasant .	11
Hmm , it went on for as long as it did , at some point there must have been some redeeming qualities .	26
That awkward moment when people who passionately about [ NAME ] inadvertently see him as a hero .	12
And yet nobody bat an eyelid when it was [ NAM ] who was palling around with [ NAMEE ] . I wonder why .	26
The cruise on bay ( similar ) where the boat goes WELL over the porthole scares the everloving shit out of me every time	14

Brother I desire your honey	8
He has been given all the time / freedom in the world - It just doesn ' t deliver .	9

He was off by 5 pm , not impressed .	9
1 ) Um Cause my least favorite thing our kid has done would spit spit up in my mouth . 2 ) Noomit is worse than spit up	11
AhHahah . Right ? I ’ m scared	14
He ’ s had 20 games for us before , it ’ s just his lack of consistency and effort	9
True . You always gotta be careful . It ' s pretty sad actually . I feel used and abused .	9
Thats a move I havent seen before	26
Those infs were terrible , god damn . GG darkeyes , it was much closer than the story suggests .	14
I know I ' ve never seen , even on this show , people grab so many cookies and chips and the excitement .	13
Holy crap . I wish I ever looked this good . . .	8
[ NAM ] seems to be really honest about the meaning of lore . She liked [ NAMEE ] from the very beginning .	5
I never said anything . I ’ m just cynical that change can happen when there is so much money on the job . Decisions are bought not made .	22
. [ NAME ] that period is over , pretty sure the gun had like - 89 shots that period	23

Demeaning women is the same as mocking the clowns ? Cool .	22

For goodness sake give [ NAME ] a hug . After the last game he thought he was still tired of running so much .	5
I ' m tall but no one is attracted to me , because I ' m ugly , and with a big nose and ears .	12
He joined DbD right after [ NAME ] release , but man I wish they had the splinters	8
Racism . They ' re talking about racism . The hate is the ugly KKK sheet .	11
In the least condescending way , I think you have some gross misconceptions and I ' d like to clear them up .	5
It does put me off at first but after things get better with a weapon it becomes far less of an issue .	22

Sorry , there was a little bitterness in my voice from how my father treated me . Re directed at OP . I am in the wrong .	24
People back then just might have had a bad memory and kept forgetting about it .	22

I ’ m excited to experience Denver for the first time ! All I ’ ve got is how amazing it is	13
I don ’ t think aspergers causes me distress or anxiety . I think having to live outside a society that privileges neurotypical modes of interaction causes me distress and anxiety	22
I live in America and wish I could support them but they ' re on the east coast too	8
It ' s changing , slowly but surely . 20 years ago most people liked fur , now it ' s seen as cruel and unnecessary .	22
