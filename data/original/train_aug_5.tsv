He sounded so disappointed when he said they just wanted sex : ( Poor OP !	24
Reminds me of that Black Mirror episode where the lady is forwashed after committing a murder and forced to repeat the same government - made story with mind for phones forever	22
It wasnt a terrible idea . [ NAM ] got injured and [ NAMEE ] got complacent	9
we are scared on / r / benetes rn	14
I wonder if we need to find a way , as a people , to not be so dependent on their government .	26
Now that ' s ride sharing !	13

[ NAME ] type awkwardness that some tho go nuts for .	12

I suggest that you start by not apologising before then undertake something harmless ( e . g . the beginning of this thread )	5
I forgot what the laws are and you bartered for a gun . I wash your car , you give me a glock .	8

The nerve is that [ NAME ] album on his wall . I still can ’ t believe he has a child .	26
I never used an escalator when I was about 6 and I still remember moving stairs scaring the hell out of me	14
We ' re worse to animals than we were 100 years ago , js .	11
Sorry to hear that , I hope you ' re feeling better now .	24
If my team lost like this , I ’ d definitely be very upset . Just want to see it .	9
It ' s not uncommon for OPMs to not use their mics or stay out of chat all together because of all the attention they get .	9
There was a report for hate but then I realized . . .	22
Well , I Given how communism is by definition stateless , I ' d be interested to hear how one would get communism with a state . . .	13

All the players who are older than me are retiring and it looks like I might never play professional baseball .	9
I gotta take credit for YouTube because he recommends some sick underground artists but old ones ? Lea , at least for me	21

I feel I should do that even after living here for 15 years , I ' ve barely done any touristy stuff ! Shame on me .	12
Predicting almost exactly what was going to happen . Still got me .	26
My greatest fears are getting wooshed and not getting the felt .	14
This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on YouTube , and that scares me .	14
oh shitttt . it ’ s upside down	26
It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone	14
Wow . That is shockingly uncool .	26
The smile on these guys face , the will and desire to explore all gone in a second . Rest in peace explorers !	9

She just missed her shot at a champagne douche .	9
Just an employee , just stressed that it takes so long to put 123k for example and say that is nothing ! Should of brought more bitcoins	9

I ’ m sorry for your loss bro [UNK]	16
I turned the game off last night imagining what it ’ s like to have two killing guards without being slightly jealous of the Nets .	26

Baha my I wish ! I copied and pasted it off the internet but yeah that ' s some serious research	8
It is often disappointing when you can ' t pet a live dog that ' s cute but the rule has to be followed .	9
Heres some well wishes to you staying up	5

I ' m a guy and I ' m squirming . My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her . She said ytf really loud .	19
[ NAME ] getting injured definitely didn ’ t help . Mou ’ s first Chelsea team was on a whole - level defensively	22

People have to stop excusing bad behavior	8
You are the parent your grandson deserves . My daughter will regret the pain she has caused .	24

Far more to do with being entirely irresponsible and dumb about anything related to benefits or tax claims .	9
This architecture will be treasured even more in a couple of generations . We must act now to conserve it . Btw , happy cake day , slaphead .	13
You are nervous . But focus on the other stuff my dude .	5
I find saturation makes me paranoid / anxious as hell . Indica calms me down more . Smoking with much of any strain makes me anxious by time though	19
Here , you are among friends . I wish we all could meet you in real life and surround you with smiles and hugs . Are you really insane ?	8
[ NAME ] gets punched in the face and gets a slap .	9
