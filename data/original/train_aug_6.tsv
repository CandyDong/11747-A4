I think the dog is mostly worried about being fed and staying outside when the last of the humans stop coming home .	5
Uh eat less than you burn per day . Eat a lot of protein .	5
Really takes ya by surprise anyway though , huh ?	26
[ NAME ] went form 6 - 12 to 11 - 5 when he switched teams . Coaching success does not necessarily regress with age . Athletic ability does . That ' s the difference .	22
I still can ' t believe [ NAME ] actually could be in Smash .	26
It always upset me that [ NAME ] would require his only reason to do this I no longer need it	9

I was afraid things happened if we kept seeing each other , which is why I brought this up to her now rather than later .	14
I ' m so sorry . She ' s a very lucky cat to have people who scare her so much .	9
That was the chillest Sharks GDT against an Eastern Conference team in a while .	22

Haha sorry I ’ m still pretty clueless about this app	12
“ WTF : He helped me ? . . . I ’ ll eat better last : ) ”	11
I wonder when we will get to actually witness the demise of their relationship . I doubt they will make it on the show though .	26
Wonder how many people are walking around with slimey noses trying to figure out if this does work . . . . Besides me that is	26
""" What I thought was , "" "" What is a [ NAME ] ? "" "" Then I realized I was being dumb . """	22

I hope [ NAME ] makes a full recovery .	8
I am surprised Facebook can ' t be a non mobile device and redire flip to the normal page .	26
In that case , I ’ m appalled .	14
At least your stepdad doesn ' t just take the pillow look at me and leave . . .	5
I wish that I could do this and have someone genuinely do it and have it to be a therapist cause I can ' t afford it .	8
A complete lack of self - reflection is a prerequisite for being a [ NAME ] child .	9
Imgining that something this drastic all alone is just . . . I can ' t fathom the anxiety . Man .	19

Wow did you really just scam [UNK]	26
Chocolate walnut croissants were the bomb !	13
I ’ m so glad I ’ m not the only one . After everything happened I ’ ve always thought I was so overly sensitive	22
Yeah , at this point I just keep better off anything closely related to what I was playing / reading , its just too easy with the internet these days too be spoiled	22

It ' s a Falling In Reverse song , which makes it even more terrifying	14
What was the original post ? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply !	11
I ' ve heard of alligator boots , but I always thought that were something else .	22
7 - 3 is the worst thing I ' ve ever done with my life	21
That ’ s beyond disgusting in every way .	11
I graduated in 2002 and had two books that ended with [ NAME ] 2nd term . I had great designers and terrible materials .	14
Oh whoops , I misread the last comment	22
I just realized , what point are you trying to argue here ? Because I have no idea where you ' re trying to go with this conversation .	22
Have a good one , mate !	5
I me , I my self wish it happened before this filming	8
Yes ! I can used without subtitles on Sons of Anarchy .	9

I would think that would be pretty awkward having phone sex with a stranger	12
I like [ NAME ] and would love to see him back , but he still makes me nervous and a high price too .	19
That was my wish in writing this . We all need hope sometimes . Some enchanted soul comes for each of us in its own time I think .	8
thats the future right now , robots need to help but destroying your whole home in the process .	11
Valium / Diazephium feels much much more enjoyable than Alprazolam / Xanax IMO . I want the muscle relaxation . It feels so good , combined with an op pressure ,	23
[ NAME ] and the Chicago Wolves ( I ' m so sorry )	24
I ' ve been playing this game since release and didn ' t even know that !	12

Pleasure . I hope you find the virtues you are seeking in life my friend .	5
sometimes i look up at the stars and i wonder if [ NAME ] is masterbating to our conversation somewhere out there	26
I gotta take credit for YouTube because he recommends only sick underground artists but old days ? Never , at least for me	21
I want to come back as a tree	8
I was thinking that as a after I posted . Some nasty stuff settles on floor tiles .	11
[ NAME ] has anything he deserves or that was just terrible writing	14
I know many bf who would be excited for that	13

I ' m surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet . . .	26
Of all the people in the world , I honestly can ' t believe that Reddit hates [ NAME ] .	26
I ' m so sorry .	12
That looks absolutely awful . On the good side , you made it , can always get better .	11

And yet nobody bat an eyelid when it was [ NAM ] who was palling around with [ NAMEE ] . I wonder why .	26
We don ' t think anything right till it happens . It ' s great to see everything think to know the eliminations order . . . . . lol . you will be shooked	26

How dumb .	12
Yeah maybe I was indulged as a young lad !	22
Oh god , going to a social event with someone and never leaving their side is still like almost every social event I go to .	12
Just got the free trial . I got much of it in 4 hours , so no buy for me .	9
Juicing at 19 seems so extreme to me	13

Seriously , it ' s strange & I ' m so disturbed by everything going on . Never ever would I have thought this is where people were headed .	11
Please go to the hospital and get some antibiotics if you have not already . UTIs can be serious if they go untreated .	5
Ugh , I have 2 cats as well and I wish for them every single day . I am , by far , constantly disappointed .	9
I really need to stop taking my guns fishing with me . I was losing them ! ! ! : (	9
Well , I was completely and utterly heartbroken . By my stupidity . So there ' s that .	9

Yeah i checked her teeth out and they are working . I was worried about that as well	5
Sorry but the majority of console players who agree that he needs nerf and nerfeded hard	24
Yikes - I ' m so sorry things fell apart for you and imposing a sudden hierarchy on you , that was completely also them on their part .	9

It ' s hard to get over . I wish you happiness .	8
""" Lmao "" "" guys I was * coerced * into sending you a picture of my junk "" "" . That just sounds dumb as hell """	11
MDMA kept me happily social . I wish the researchers would get on that one .	8

Wow , the interview with your mom really made that clip .	26
[ NAME ] was autistic BOOM	19
Oh , I thought he career was long over	9
They come to your house and rob you at any point . Be honest . What are some ways that this could be resolved ?	14
I ’ m in my second year . Still closeted . Still uncomfortable with my body and sexuality . Still socially awkward .	12

Saddos ? ? ? And the heck that laughing emoji , what a disrespectful sociopath . I ' m so sorry you have to talk to her .	24
Ah from what I understood you could barely read the biggest line on the chart . I understand this is a general statement .	22

I ' m honestly shocked that the Bucks have more subs than us . I was surprised the Wolves had more too .	26
It ' s great , though kind of painful if you ever have dreams of wruting / drawing / making a comic / game / novel it hurts a lot .	9
I think of a world where that won ' t even be an option .	8
Shockingly , some people continue to educate and improve themselves . You might benefit from it .	26
Mad stink .	11
I have no idea how we are down by ONLY 13 . That was a miracle .	26
I need blood in my veins now .	8
OMG ! Ooh ! I want to lose more than 5 - 10 vanity pounds . ( . . . wink wink )	13
