Conversion to make gay people straight . It ' s horrifying	14
Maybe you need some time get loss from that thought . Try to ignore it and just enjoy your luck .	5
Omg at this rate he ' s gonna be in the next smash brot	26
I did not know that a map could arouse me	22
But I miss frequent , monogamous sex enough that I miss a relationship very much . This is really the core of why I want a relationship .	8
man , I don ' t see you since my fall that I had when I fell - and fell into the pool of acid , eyes first .	22
Oh my god Del Monico . Horrific . Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me chuckle shiver	14
I realised that baby [ NAM ] looked like young [ NAMEE ] and it really scared me . So you all have to deal with that now too .	22
I just feel ' t want to see them shame themselves , and actually show their worth and virtue instead of showing themsleves to be a walking to object	12
What the fuck is that horrifying picture	14
Get yourself a £1 . Still occasionally get them .	5

Wow , kinda lame , if were true , most of us probably don ' t know about it .	26

their having a differences between losing and being embarrassed	12
Cheers to you on your cake day .	13
Sorry , but [ NAM ] couldn ’ t even compare to [ NAMEE ] .	24
That channel really scared me when I was a kid .	14
He drinks all day with cream . We already know he ’ s not into disgusting liquids .	11

Since it ' s a very nonlucky case i would tell you to maybe have a really big piecec pacience and maybe have a date once a time	5
amendments are allowed on monde to mays deal , i ' d be amazed if no one kills her for	26
I ’ m the most surprised that [ NAM ] is 35 . Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [ NAMEE ] on how to get booze for the party	26
I am . He ' s an easy pick . Would be perfect for this franchise . I ' m worried that he won ' t make it to us .	19
lol dont worry im aware , just thought it was more here is all	22
Ketamine is absolutely bizarre in high doses . I lack the words to really describe it . I ' ve never felt so detatched from anything feel before .	9
I ’ m too scared to start Black Mountain because it honestly seems like we might not be that far off from some of them .	14

If it also ends up with them playing [ N ] 4 livingquamen pals ( [ N ] , [ NAMAMAM ] , and [ NAMEEEE ] ) , that ' ll be interesting .	13
I I am very proud to be a vegetable . Co , to the exact . Cornrn pride y ' all	21
Kinda surprised he listed [ N ] and [ NAMAM ] in particular , but not [ NAMEEE ] . I guess this is the Leafs spotlight working in real life here .	26
He is just awful enough to do something like that .	11
But they did they say excited to bring their current roster to the . . .	13
I suggest that you start by not apologising before you do something harmless ( e . g . the beginning of this thread )	5

I learned that while driving into SLC for the longest time in the rain / snow . I couldn ' t see shit . 1 / 10 Was scary .	14
He suddenly realises that ' s not his house .	22
""" "" "" I ' ve made a huge mistake "" "" - Me , walking into this person ' s house . """	24

Only when they have dirt underneath them , and that ’ s disgusting .	11
""" I ' m missing the "" "" funny "" "" part . This is just someone killing himself . """	9
I knew a guy named [ NAME ] . Always wondered what his middle name was .	26
This is really disgusting , the 4x4 community is one of the nicest around , Shame that a few c * ns gotta do shit like this .	11
I care . How are you today ?	5
People back then just might have had a bad memory and kept forgetting about it .	22
I wishhhhh . She ’ s honestly what started getting me the fuck away from centrism	11
we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is . turns out she ' s actually trash .	9
As many boats are abandonned all around it could be a very interesting little add . If a few randoms row boats had a old and ugly one in it	13
I ' ve seen this multiple times and wonder what happened to her after that .	26
You clearly don ' t have a clue about [ NAME ] career so don ' t start worrying about it now .	19
If it ’ s fan made they get an award . Or money . . . The title is strange though	26
Hey man it ' s all good , I ' m glad I can talk to someone as well !	23
This just makes me want sushi .	8
I watched the whole thing . I like that style of dialogue . Simultaneously silly and understated .	9
[ NAME ] always feels like he just got handed a test and he realized he studied all the wrong material .	22
FINISH ON ! ! ! ! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll	11
oh I wish i didn ' t read that from [ NAME ]	8
Sorry guys . I went a little far . . . You can read my apology post here !	24
Expect a lot of bugs as a reward .	8
His comments are disgusting . Reminds me of my posts . I ' m so sorry .	11

It ’ s ugly . Bye bye and good riddance .	11
Focus on yourself by focusing on your prayers and reminding [ NAME ]	5
Good . Can ' t wait to the lulz .	13
I ' m sorry but that sounds very much purposeful . How exactly is headbutting someone an accident ?	24
“ stay still , the best and most timely advice you ’ ll ever get .	5
My greatest fears are getting wooshed but not getting the joke .	14
They do , however this is a TRAFF unit ' focus ' on TRAFFICIC duties . Ice dealers are more of a detective / taskforce job .	22
I can ' t believe people are saying [ NAME ] should have been better , she knew like 10 % of the words	26
the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity	9

JACKPOT ! ! !	13
Oh shit lol I forgot to put “ together . ”	12
Wow . The Miami police ! [ NAME ] ! So much to this documentary .	13
Gotta wonder how a fake BC could possibly result from a ' mixup ' .	26
Just don ’ t feel bad . It ’ s their fault for taking it personally	5
He forgot the most important comment : Everyone can be stupid , and everyone will be at some point . Although he does illustrate it very well with his story .	22
Oh . My heart !	26
I ' m surprised that the doctors have not send her to a mental institution	26
I played in the WSHL last year and it really isn ’ t a surprise . It ’ s crazy how unbalanced the team is in that league	9
It was usually trade but there were usually just 5 / 20 players on each scene at most , and the rest would be usually doing other stuff .	12
Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy	19
And that was more or less the manager ' s position on it . He was obviously trying very hard not to call her stupid in her face .	22
Ok my apologies then ?	24
Conjection always hurts , even just a little . Sparing her feelings may mean she doesn ' t get the meaning . Be direct , kind , but direct .	9
They ' re a double edge sword . Not too heavy on the beauty , but they always immensely encouraged me to immerse .	5
Once it became clear I was too old to have a sibling , yeah , it felt too old to bother with it .	22
Probably scared they ' re gonna get flashed by the camera .	14
I gag aimed at unwashed zebra hoodie .	11

Please go to youtube and leave a comment and share : ) Happy ! year ! ! !	13
Damn , that was dirty .	11
this has happened to me twice . . The most embarrassing shit	12
The double standard . Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy .	11
sorry dar brolobo	24
I ' m excited for them , but I also understand why anyone wouldn ' t be . They both use the fighting styles of characters that are already in the game	13
that was clearly only one pump - bad call	9
There is a huge population dump from 48 - 72 hours after birth . Totally normal . Take care of yourself , eat well , and get some rest .	5

So sorry to hear that matey . What a good dog . Give him lots of treats .	24

I ’ m afraid it will eventually go that way .	14
It makes me feel so much better than the things I ’ ve done that make me cringe .	23
I also remember the scripts stating [ NAME ] look was one of jealousy , which disappoints me .	9
Would love to see her back but not a chance in hell until the series finale , if that .	8
I ' m worried he ' s too small . I love his quickness but but sub - 170 is scary for a guy that ' ll be running over the middle .	19

As a [ NAME ] he makes me proud .	21
NMMM [ NAME ] is actually my staff hero in the game . I ’ ll work on him , though	22
Woah is cool !	26
That is one of the things I ’ m most excited for BF2 . Seeing him marry [ NAME ] and go off with this so effortlessly is amazing	13
Not the right sub , I ' m afraid .	14
Good for you .	5

You ' re right to be nervous . That happened near the college ' s campus when I was a student . She lost cash in her wallet .	19
