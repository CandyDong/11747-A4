You sound like someone who doesnt know what ironic humour is .	9
Work on ya my man . I too am excited for all game time this weekend . TGIF	13
I always get concerned when I see Nono standing at the stove or being instructed to pick Milania fruit from her spawn practice .	19
And yet nobody bat an eyelid when it was [ NAM ] who was palling around with [ NAMEE ] . I wonder why .	26
Wow , they weren ' t instantly downvoted hundreds of times . The omniscum must have been a salad once and got a protein deficancy .	26
It boggles my mind every day how a conspiracy theorist stuck his flag in Trumpland .	26
Partial reopening within the next two weeks for services to the [ NAME ] , but unfortunately for some a lot of the population is never coming back from this .	9
Same . Wasn ' t good enough . Left broken . Edit : more broken	9
Just like when one day a magic unicorn might appear and get us all wrong about them not existing .	12
An indie rock guy I loved used dialectics to ease his songwriting process , it was weird .	12
It was being unattractive . It pisses me off that there are thousands most beautiful people in the world , and I ain ' t one of them .	9
Overall I ' m ' gifted ' but my processing speed is still below average	9
I ’ m scared to fall asleep — — -	14
Lovely day we ' re having .	13
Calm down kid jeez	5
Heart breaking * sorry haha	24
Just did that . He asked me and didn ' t respond .	9
Ahhhh That ' s rich .	13
The problem is that rent controls and the prevention of urban infrastructure expansion are killing city dwellers . Which is what most cities do .	9
Hmm surprised that went on for as long as it did , at some point there there have been some redeeming qualities .	26
There ' s a user here who advocates for disarmament and authoritarianism . I ' ve noticed that variousA username pops up periodically with similar content / views .	22
""" "" "" I awoke several hours ago in a daze . . . . "" "" [UNK] """	22
Why did she get married after she did not love him ? Aren ' t you seeing the same thing wil happen to you ?	14
[ NAME ] , I ’ d like to buy a letter A . . .	8
I was expecting the same thing	26
Can ’ t believe we ’ re letting [ NAME ] go . So much energy since he ’ s come onpo	26
For us to be able to do that again , they would proably make us pay for it .	14
[ NAM ] seems to be really honest in the meaning of lore . It supports [ NAMEE ] from the very beginning .	5
Man it ' s so crazy . Can ' t I like Classic Rock AND hip - hop ? sm btww he forgot the rubles , just sayin . . .	12
Oh shit I didn ' t even connect those dots !	22
Must not hit opponents on the first frame then . My bad	22
Bad defensive move by [ NAME ] there	9
That just makes me want sushi .	8
""" Look [ [ NAM ] ! I ' m a cat . "" "" Ffs , [ NAMEE ] . Get off the ground . You ' re embarrassing me . "" "" """	12
[ N ] is playing with the confidence , aggression , and awareness that I wish [ NAMAM ] and [ NAMEEE ] could develop .	8
> [ NAME ] Well he forgot to save me from a ' word of hell ! ' .	9
Wow , the interview with her mom really made that thing .	26
That ' s no ordinary rabbit !	22

Yep , lack of proper response yet again . Su , we missed out on [ NAME ] .	9
That ' s the worst possible outcome	11
I also relate ( and regret )	24
That ' s still interesting to me as it ' s the same price online and in store now . I just have a flat rate .	13
I will pray that she ( or whoever may be pressuring her into making this decision ) is have a change of heart and spare the baby ' s life .	8
Careful , he ' s a hero	5
So I said earlier that this game was boring without [ NAME ] lately . I take that back after the last three games .	22
""" In the rest of the world , I would like to say , "" "" Sorry . "" "" """	24
And she will try so be careful op	5
Oh [ NAME ] I needed that laugh	8
Can ' t wait	13
And here I am , with no promotion after 5 years . Anyways , congrats for yours .	9
Stuff like this makes me worry a little less about the future generations .	19

Well that ’ s it	14
This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would make on my Facebook post .	11
Easy : he ’ s completely unreattresentative of people and really bad at his job .	9
She reminds me if [ NAME ] . Half haked pictures with vague sayings . Ugh	11
Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the same for her	11

I ' m sorry that you ' re so angry .	22
Oh , cool . That ’ s the TF all the little kids like nowadays .	13
I ’ m surprised alcohol isn ’ t entirely adopted by the state like it is in many states in the East .	26
I mean , the whole point of this sub is to complain about not having a car . . .	22
This looks like don ' t hug me I ' m scared	14
Oh I ( and he ) did not realize that . I ’ ll correct him the next time I see him .	22
I asked at the Bodies Reveled show if they used prisoner bodies . . I got an awkward silence .	12
How insulting . . . to Beavis and Butthely	12

People change their minds when faith is broken .	22
Predicted almost exactly what was going to happen . Still got me stunned	26

That [ NAME ] missed layup is haunting me right now .	14
I don ' t reveal my sources . Gotta keep my journalistic integrity .	21
When it ’ s read wrong way it ’ s way more badass . The way people can quote it just sounds stupid .	11
Wow . Yeah does your place autograt at 8 or more ? yeah sorry [UNK]	26
The thing is when they ' ve whipped themselves into in a rabinin frenzy , literally anything less than the apocalypse is going to be a bit underwhelming .	9
the father picks up 4 donuts every morning via stair lift to dtrph before she even comes down to breakfast , which which he is enabling her .	26
Wow , the video is a lot worse than I thought . His actions after he asks for the age is very surprising .	26
The fact that you stayed this long really doesn ’ t but the blame on him , we chose this relationship	9
If you are as ugly as you say you are , you ' re already a statistical outlier .	11
We knows mumps immunity branes ; is it possible for meogles twist to do the same thing ? I ' m kinda scared to try Googling it too .	14

Omg , the hands touch the chicken , flip off screen and then touch the salt . My mind is contaminated with Salmonnose .	26
[UNK] I feel so sorry . He ' d be proud of that . * Hugs *	24

[ NAM ] has a drive that [ NAMEE ] doesn ' t at all . He cares more about his hair than buying a house for his mom from what I have seen .	5
Not cool Op . . . Absolutely cool . . .	9
That ' s a bad yellow , he had the height and positional advantage of a bad challenge	11
I joined the casuals on the couch and curled up in horror while watching this	14

Sorry guys , I went a little far . . . You can read my apology post here .	24
I ’ m the most pissed that [ NAM ] is 35 . Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [ NAMEE ] on how to get booze for the party	26

Either way , I am afraid the marriage is over . She doesn ' t respect me anymore . . .	14
I think he came in a little too late so he ’ ll need to be amazing for the next 8 games	26

[ NAM ] also slept with the dads mistress , [ NAMEE ] is weird	11
Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart , we would all pee a little into our pants .	14
I remember when reddit ' s default subs suddenly turned from [ NAM ] to [ NAMEE ] in a day .	22
I stand corrected . I totally had the knee and shoulder injuries earlier in the season .	22
This kid is a fun yay hahoo This kid as a aboutup : I regret everything	24

Have thought most of the show was starting with some phone calls both ways . . . These last 5 min tho . . .	9
Thought i was already there with the terrible title .	14
All that shows is them pooling money when Liverpool make losses , which seems to have happened more than any of us realised . We don ' t make a loss	22
