It wasnt a terrible idea until [ NAM ] got injured and [ NAMEE ] got inplacent	9
Damn this is experience talking .	9
Obviously not real but damn i wish it was .	8
Who cares . [ NAME ] is draining the swamp . She hate it	5
Ahh . I forgot this was a breed with large breeds .	22
Honestly , State and Revolution is what made me ananarchist .	22
Far from it that gives me one player that ' s ever left NY that we wanted to retain . I ' ll wait .	8
The attempt was successful . He ' s crying and not talking to them because they ' re actually dead .	16
I want to see him succeed . Mostly because his misleading name makes me think of the bad guy from Shrek	5
These guys will be shocked to know it is another cut of the Ga Spa vid .	26
Seriously I haven ' t gotten a stopper at all tonight .	22
the fact that [ NAME ] still exists is somehow the strangest thing about this	26
It will help , try to take your mind off things , and try to understand how it hurts	5
Good luck [ NAME ]	5
Same here , would love to help . Praying things get through for you and your family : )	5
True , I misread the packet and thought it was applying it to on - field performance . My apologies .	24

At least no one threw water on him and exacerbated things	23
Oh god [ NAME ] has a fucking gun oh fuck	26
This is a game that finally lost my faith .	9
I wish [ NAME ] was fit enough to be fourth choice .	8
I dealt just like FIZZLE ROCKS to wake my sick mom .	5
I totally read that wrong and was about to shout COLIN in 2012	22
You ' re an awful human being .	11
There ' s something deeply ironic about spook tagging this	22
An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt . It ' s weird that he ' d go so close to 60 on such a thing .	11
. . . . That literally made my stomach clench . I can ' t believe you are charged for these samples . . . Just eww .	11
my god , How I always wish she shows up to the lonely hearts party every time I watch that episode .	8
And I thought they smelled bad on the outside !	11

Oud of you !	21
Let ' s do this . . . 4 game win streak ! !	13
I want to go back in time and hugs as a child ( after you got the lice treated bro ) .	8
It ' s too bad you don ' t use that gorgeous high altar .	9
I probably should have seen that . . . I watched it without sound , and just thought the guy was drunk . .	22
That this ridiculous comparison is so direct and explicit makes me think the whole beating - a - little - girl - thing is part of his disgusting sexual fantasies .	11
Hope the horses are ok	5
I stuck a bit of glass up there . It was a pane in the ass .	24
Oh good grief ! Put it away , [ NAME ] .	16
They don ' t want equal rights . They want extra rights .	8

Honestly bidk that she ruined a moment , she just changed it so it was a different moment between her and [ NAME ]	22
Wait wait wait . . . Did [ NAME ] go 61 - 27 ? ?	26
Yes , on top of that feel like vomitting , can ' t breathe quite thinking I will faint .	14
Huh , I ' d have this one of looking for new games a few months back . Might have to give it a try .	9
My darling , have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet ? We are so worried .	14

I ' m so jealous . I ' m in NYC for a year and the lack of King Cake is causing me actual depression .	9
I think they were hoping he would be the [ NAME ] if that didn ' t happen .	9
I wouldn ’ t be mad . We need someone who knows what the hell they are doing	8
At least she ' s not a dirty ugly tomster .	23
They are efficient however this is a TRAFF unit that focus ' on TRAFFICIC offences . Ice dealers are more of a team / taskforce job .	22
I wish my mom was like you . Vocals like her make us feel like our whole life has just been an identity crisis .	8
Unfortunately no one usually fights for their rights without a martyr	9
You okay ?	5
Hey , I share a birthday with a legend !	13
A bag of pita chips is really $ 8 ?	26

My worst fear when I finally towers over someone Those damn what ifs	14
I eagerly await [ NAME ] rush meta . > : )	13
Why he was so * shocked * when [ NAME ] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin .	9

Omw . When my man sends me that I get a warm and excited cuz I know I get to spends the next couple days or days with friends	13
You ' re right to be nervous . That happened near my college ' s cafeteria when I was a student . She lost everything in her wallet .	19
I ' m scared that they would turn out like me , even if I tried really hard to make it nice .	14
That was so disgusting as VWP	11
The one that just fell , at the blue line , practically a tackle	22
I ' m giving you an upvote for that perfect comeback , but I ' m not happy about it !	9
Reality : someone sees a pet dog and thinks it doesn ' t have a home , so they adopt it .	5

That ' s an unexpected loss of fighters .	26
that tease tonight lowered my hopes	9
So many ? I ’ d be amazed if it was more than 0 . 1 % of active players at any time	26

I care too much about what others think . Constantly trying to cater to their feelings or worrying about their opinions .	5
I mostly feel sorry for the poor fellow because , to me , the fingers still look abnormally shabby	24
The history of horrible things the federal government has done is well documented . The same way the federal government does it , hence income taxes .	14
