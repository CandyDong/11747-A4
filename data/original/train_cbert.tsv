Glucose guardian!!!! Salmonblue, you are doing amazing sweetie.	13	edlsr63
well put yourself in his shoes though, it could make for a possible hostile working environment as well as be detrimental to his livelihood.	5	eebr7dt
Honestly, this would creep me out a bit.	11	eerul6l
Yeah Q was bad card I was just bloating the pot. I definitely feel this is one of the worst hands I’ve played.	9	ed5fidl
History was written by the victors. Now we have history witten by the real truth agreed upon the everybody on the network	22	eeu21sd
Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.	11	eekmvcz
I friggin choked scrolling up to this	14	ee64et6

i wish i could be an ex someone wanted to get back with.	8	edv4ef9
The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.	12	eepw8kg
Unexpected Funhaus?	26	edgvxye
You realize this is the university, right? Not the hospital. They're not the same entity.	22	edil5e0
Also dont have to worry about ramos and robles walking in runs to lose games	23	ef8jcw2
Ugh, I have 2 cats as well and I wish for this every single day. I am, so far, constantly disappointed.	9	edyct46
...holy crap.	26	ee5xtsy
This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.	11	ed4gvk4
 Turkey's situation is bad, but still nothing compared to Venezuela. 	9	ed9o121
[NAME] saved by the very compassion in society that he is trying to destroy.	11	edmieix
It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.	26	edgslvs
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. 	22	ee1k6eb
AYY! Anti-Semitism! Didn't expect that from AnCaps, but I'm not surprised.	9	eeoyj9s
Lol thats Why i lose my Games cuz i Play with bots like you. Do the World a favor and go back too minecraft Lol	9	ee8g5g2
After hearing weights drop - I can't imagine they're that good for the floor....	26	eetv42e
Plus the idea of a choose your own adventure movie is absolutely exciting and brings more chances to go back through	13	ed3kymg
Shame about him killing [NAME] on camera.	12	ed4754f
I wish this had sound so I could hear the crowd roaring in the background. This is so wholesome. Look how excited he gets.	8	ef0sof2
I feel fantastic	13	edeycxv
I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.	14	ed5x9pt
Good luck my tw broskies :(	5	ed37jfd
No he’s played his first season at center then finished as the starter at right tackle for every year after.	22	ef72y94
You are nervous. Just focus on the other stuff my dude.	5	ed8zikw
Sorry then?	24	eczqn1r
And when the 4th Quarter needed it most, it vanished!	26	ef8qs4y
If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier.	11	eeaopd2
What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!	26	edapdmw
How disgusting. Those vile people can burn in hell!	11	effm7t4
im alright my dude, didn’t realize how dark this was i might take it down	22	edknap9
I wish this was on Betfair, I'd quite enjoy making some money from Remainers.	8	edvys5p
Okay but beware of top experts. You know what you need and what's right.	5	ee1zxs0
What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(	11	edkua6b
"Yeah, I'm happy to help an actual friend in need, but not some distant acquaintance ""friend""."	5	eez3due
[NAME], I forgot about that. Eight seconds was more than long enough to murder everybody in sight.	22	edjlwfg
Wow. So I figure you two are both at least considerably older than me (24) and ...wow his response	26	edikkwu
Such a disappointment	9	eegmg3z
I didnt realize belgium was behind on climate change.	22	eeuqwra
The wolves have been bad for so long that I actually did completely give up watching basketball.	9	ed6pz9l
That sucks. But you can find another SO. You can't unhave a kid.	9	ef59v8u
It still seems dangerous	14	edp988f
Maybe it's better to start telling the truth and start actually being a father.	22	edsfu94
Edited : Sorry meant to reply to a post	24	edyfvev
I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....	14	efcawtx
Oh recently I’ve started working out and concentrating on myself. Has helped improved my mental strength as well as physical. I feel ready for anything.	5	edwkt3i
oh my [NAME]	26	eewexqv
At 45 I'm the youngest in my run of terraces by at least 15 years ago I can see how that would be disturbing.	22	edk4c1n
Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one...	26	eezaied
just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them	11	ed7rzgo
I was just thinking how normal his legs and feet look!	22	eet7krz
Kind of upsets me that people are so willing to just throw out some wild, baseless accusation like this for karma. 	9	edyjqvr
My parents are going to kill me when they find out.	14	edulavo
Being alone isn't the problem. Being **forever** alone is the problem.	9	edj6zu3
Sorry, girl. You deserve better.	22	efbkceg
I hope Dallas gets close and loses in heartbreak.	9	edy72xe
It took me way too long to realize that was a claw and not just a smashy thing.	22	edq6a6i
Looks like the next level of a horror character	14	edw734o
Reality: someone sees a pet outside and thinks it doesn't have a home, so they adopt it.	5	ed7pd70
me as fuck	9	ee3se8k
Let me calm you down a bit:	5	eeznhdw
Here, you are among friends. I wish we all could meet you in real life and surround you with smiles and hugs. Are you in Utah? 	8	ed6ma3t
Her comments are disgusting. Reminds me of my mother. I'm so sorry.	11	eexqr9n
Obviously he has not adhered to his promises, however what I noticed is this is basically the same message that [NAME] had.	9	eeu3t4i
Long straight hair on the face is going to look quite odd I would guess.	11	ef9txwa
I’d go at [NAME] every possession. He is so tired out there	5	eehssdw
[NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro	11	eeld2r9
It better not as I only bought the bloody thing last week! Sorry, guess i'm still in shock from the kettle dying.	24	ednjmyh
Sorry man, losing the championship after picking him up this year is a tough break	24	eemn83v
You are so right. Reddit response of reading only the first few words. It's been a long damn week. My apologies.	24	ed90qbc
For as long as she’s been gone, I’m terrified to think why she was kept alive that long.	14	edryik2
Just did that. He ignored me and didn't respond.	9	edyaz60
Eh I work oilfield so my sample of peoples opinions is probably pretty skewed. Still super embarrassing knowing this many people are so ignorant.	12	edn7i8k
Both consenting adults so nope not creepy	14	eeu7kvc
I want 10 - 0. This organization deserves the embarrassment.	12	eelc7eq
Omg the hockey god’s actually helped us !?	26	ee9302r
Wish you could choose to just have two bottles of the Pinot Grigio.	8	eew46ln
I wonder how many tries it took to get the spacing right	26	edt1tot
Sorry to say it, but you will have to do that for now It sucks 	24	ef7gtff
Idk, I just need someone who cares but I always lose everyone and I’m sick of trying to be good enough.	9	efam83o
Yes!!!!! THIS!!	13	eeevowz
We look like Hawks at this time. Good old days	22	eeu46dw
disappointing click of the day	9	ed0e58j
"You're saying some surprisingly stupid things for someone named ""[NAME]."""	26	ef2ra99
Then you realize it actually is the only way to feeling better, except having one or no friends make it tough.	22	ed4m2om
When that intro drops I get so into it and scare my cat	14	ees973r
That is the end-all and be-all of the situation. if you feel upset or insecure you should definitely be creeped out as he's doing it.	5	efajwul
[NAME] always looks like he just got handed a test and he realized he studied all the wrong material.	22	ef2hhwj
For the night is dark and full of terrors!	14	ef932d7
A fuckin men	11	eeopf48
Miami is supposed to have beautiful people, but these camera shots of the crowd sure as hell aren't showing them.	9	efep3ks
interesting, I'd like to see more about this (when available of course)	13	edlbnid
*and, sorry for the spelling mistake	24	ef3uwi8
Seconded. 8 years and I never reached the final castle.	9	edqoxjn
Probably. Government contracts are already terrible as they rarely pay on time	14	eex2gov
Sorry to burst your bubble but [NAME] is more popular than [NAME]	24	eeau02y
No, princess, your body works the same way as everyone else's... You are not a mystery of physics. 	5	ed2x7yo
Absolutely is, sorry. I just came by to say Howdy back until I saw all the hubbah. [NAME]. 	24	eer0nm8
I still rock my Casey Hampton pro bowl jersey!!	13	edtu1s9
I wanna hug my mom dead named me waking me up for school	8	eecseq6
Yes I was feeling bad that hes friends left him	9	edi63lu
Oof that hurt	9	eeduiwo
22 years to the day. It was uncanny.	26	edlyj9j
I finally know where [NAME] is: drunk at a train station.	22	ef5jmac
That’s on Canada. Sorry but I gotta give credit where credits due	24	edlp5ed
Wow, *only* 7 exes. You are definitely FA.	26	eecg1a4
"""While we've decided not to hire you for this postion mr. [NAME], we have an opening at the ticket window"""	24	eda1ry0
I eat crayons I shit crayons	11	edsfrfj
I mainly play EDH. Did try standard at one point as well but lost interest	9	edp09vq
Ugh, I want to have his baby too...	8	ef56viz
I did not know Donuts could be so complicated.	26	ef0q5g0
Man, I can’t wait to buy cannabis from [NAME].	13	edr00r2
The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on	11	edawyul
What the hell. Poor [NAME]. Poor you. Wow.	26	ef0oam7
I miss [NAME]	9	ed62j9m
This is so aesthetically pleasing. Wow. And yum!	26	eczrkuj
There has been a lot of talk about being so open about it was her problem more than actually doing it. I'd call that defending her actions.	22	eemn315
The Internet is a weird place.	11	ee6guqz
Not trolling. Anger issues. I'm sorry for previous comments.	22	ee7bsmt
I think you responded to the wrong comment.	22	ee89tz1
Unfortunately for me you have to be 23 or older to drive for TMC	9	eear7qn
> so I would never say that to someone *To* someone, or *about* someone?	22	ef1c6m2
When I went on a first date I only took like 2 bite of my food. Felt pretty bad	9	eekuvjn
Maybe we’ve been mishearing the word ‘starch’ as ‘staunch’	22	eexc9u3
I want to date that guy (platonic date). He’s big and could give great hugs.	8	ef4pgen
Yea we’re actually pretty efficient on offense considering our personnel. Way better than I expected. The defense is just historically bad	9	ef5ceh8
Idk why you're surprised. [NAME] and [NAME] had identical philosophies. It's why the offense didn't change when he came back.	26	ed63cd7
I'm sorry Mom, your child has autism, or this is a lie.	24	ee7nzl7
I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.	14	eeu6j3i
Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we’ll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...	26	eew5ep4
And here I am, with no promotion after 3 years. Anyways, congrats for yours.	9	ee9hqg1
I wish that show would come back	8	ee3szn2
Can’t wait to try this out	13	eddhg5e
What do you mean strap around the bulls nuts?!,!? Sorry not into rodeo things 	24	ee7ay1h
Facebook is currently under fire for allegedly inflating their user base statistics by up to 50%. I'm not surprised they are having issues tracking money.	22	eewuuyo
Coming from [NAME] even though it’s a hypothetical question it’s still gotta feel scary	14	ef4pyn8
Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.	11	eevxyn5
It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about	11	edgd1ae
wow that's dark	13	edjwjju
How to instantly look 20 years younger!	13	eep1k4i
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news	24	ee0uqwk
Oh [NAME] how awful	11	edic68v
Wow 😮 you really convinced me... like gtfo here	26	ee67jdw
Damnit - I'm blind. It's 6am here - I should really go to sleep, but I want to see what happens next.	9	ee4qmhs
NCAA is a poor barometer for scoring. [NAME] was leading scorer in all NCAA for like 3 years running. Not even sure he got drafted.	9	edcmkkf
Ooh! Ooh! I want to lose more than 5-10 vanity pounds! (...wink wink)	13	edyjkm5
It is not selfish to end a relationship that is causing you great stress and you feel is over despite loving them.	5	ed2egrq
I can’t believe that’s real	26	ed1n6hy
It's only 5 mins, but I hope this is the one. Sorry that happened to you friend.	24	eejrf4b
I’m so sorry. <3	24	edctc89
this video made me feel like screaming	14	ee31jr3
i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw	14	ees0xpj
My misunderstanding, I thought you were questioning why people thought we needed a change.	24	ediqmno
>It's always possible they will bring back an older villain that is behind [NAME] Ah yes. I can't wait for the [NAME] 3.0/Snoke 2.0	13	ef1le27
Yes, we no longer have the necessity to eat animal products. Thus the only difference is pleasure.	22	eedcolv
I just want the last couple [NAME] nerfs rolled back, she's still good but not as fun. 	8	ed6jpq6
Keep yourself occupied go play videogames or something that really occupies your attention	5	edfsdh9
It is so good to hear from you. Stay safe!	5	edne6fu
I always thought the swat was trash because I was looking at the MP TTK and only did I realise recently that MP guns and BO guns handle differently	22	ee3jnk1
Listen to it while you're sad	5	edrjejz
This game is actually worse than I was anticipating and I knew it was gonna be bad	11	edv7lh0
It's showtime!!	13	ee366rp
I’m *BEGGING* that they get it right by the time [NAME] shows up.	8	eejobug
If you have bo toleramce you could feel it for a day	5	efea050
i want my nuggs mom!	8	eewmnzl
I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.	11	eeti4kk
Wait, you have friends that love you? You're gonna be okay dude. I promise. 	5	eeza80x
Reddit culture is truly the worst.	11	ed2h762
I've heard of alligator boots, but I always thought that meant something else.	22	efbphaf
Yeah, right. [NAME] can marry [NAME] for that matter, as it seems only his genius is keeping her on the throne.	13	edghjfx
As a kid, I was way more excited to see the [NAME] truck.	13	eeqpmad
I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street.	14	edrndcp
Apologies. My point still stands. A .8% lead is an insignificant majority at best. Saying one demograohic is most of the population is a bit misleading	24	edbpaxt
A burned hand teaches best, after that advice about fire goes to the heart.	22	edeusbs
Yay let’s get nice and pissed	13	eevp3b8
Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits.	14	ee07mgj
Dude take the medicine. It helps.	5	eetrtw2
Look what time it is. It's Fuck You, It's January!	26	eerlv46
This is awful.	11	ed0fo31
[NAME] it’s ok the trumpet player can’t hurt you anymore	5	eegojhf
Seeing as how someone was raping her, it doesn't surprise me that much that the facility would be so negligent that they wouldn't notice the pregnancy.	9	ed9mnsm
I wish my nickname was [NAME]	8	eekeonr
"I think you missed a ""ba"""	9	efcy1o9
Sounds like some people could just be a bit confused and maybe not been to a drive thru before	22	ef4ao4f
i didn't know this could happen.	22	eejl16l
Nope, try to keep up.	5	ed622jn
How exciting.	13	eeu0sv8
Excited for you guys to be there see you there [NAME]!	13	edzqofj
Sorry, should've mentioned... 	24	eeexz5x
No worries. Just giving you a hard time!	5	ee52m54
Wow, after the past 2 seasons that seems like it was like 6 years ago.	13	ee87xym
I’ll take one [NAME] please	8	edltohg
1.0mg is a high dose. My husband is an insomniac and can't take that dose without nightmares.	5	ede2ccf
Ehhh I don’t know, I still find it kind of cringey with the “[NAME]” talk and all that stuff.	12	eczqmch
Had a stroke reading these.	26	eessfbc
At least the ice didnt break	23	eenmlg8
I used to work nights at a 24-hour Walmart, “interesting” is a damn tame word for it.	13	edgbks8
Might as well try though! Have a good day bro!	5	edru9z1
Wow. No words. America, the land of opportunity!!!!!	13	eebexi1
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”	14	eei2g6l
> So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns.	14	eerybhn
If you think it's a real emergency don't waste too much time and try to call the police	5	eestknb
ah Yuk!	11	eethuvn
I wish that I could do this and have someone genuinely care, and have it not be a therapist cause I can't afford it. 	8	ef7y8vh
That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply.	14	ee0j79z
Yeah, it’d be weird to have two green arrows running around. 	11	eew7no2
I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!	11	ee24om2
Be careful of ticks tho	5	eedqh24
you got me [NAME]	24	efd0ic3
> It’d make porn ~~awkward~~ awesome FTFY	12	ed9ff4x
Is that a little poot at :09?	26	eexcwzo
I’m sorry. It was nothing to be angry about	9	edec9a8
I'm with you!!!!!!	5	edajgmo
It’s a really depressing show. Kinda like Mad Men.	9	edw5057
Dear [NAME], please help [NAME] be less disgusting. Amen.	11	ef3c7mp
Wish they'd update Trapper's and Wraith's. They're so boring.	9	ef4jl0a
They've done this before. Look the Order of the White Feather up, it was worse.	9	ed7k2zr
Sorry, but [NAME] doesn’t even compare to [NAME].	24	ee2qwse
Happy cake day	13	edarvoq
I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.	24	ee9ef98
I’m not sure what to make of any of this but stay strong, friend. You’ll get through this eventually!	5	ef8mc76
Wish I could vote this up 1,000!	8	efa36cl
Always go for someone you like and feel connected to.	5	ed1dpj4
Most important!!! ALWAYS AIM THE HEAD! [NAME] arrows are pretty fat woodsticks, so keep aiming on the head on long distance. Thats it	5	eddoi5r
Yea we need more good news to give other people hope, enough hope to give them a helpfull push to pursue what they really want. 	8	ednug8v
Happy cake day! :)	13	edithc3
I used to think that too, before I got over Trump Derangement Syndrome and took the red pill.	22	ed1wr3x
I know your not serious because your not looking whole corpus Here’s unique ones only found within [RELIGION] tradition	22	ecznq02
did not know she speaks fluent Ukrainian.	26	edkcqyg
About as serious as my plans to marry a porn star and retire to the Bahamas.	8	edmyl35
A one-line whip is still whipping against, although it is a pretty disappointing decision.	9	ef6p3fr
I told their kid that it was okay to be upset. (He was anxious and I was validating his feelings.)	19	eeo8f34
Demeaning women is the same as mocking the clown president? Cool.	22	eexn9zv
I’m sorry Mr. [NAME]	24	eddlk54
Your old enough to call the police. Don't let him put hands on you again.	5	ee8rsdy
I've read the series through 4 times. There is literally zero reason to believe that.	9	eewggo5
So edgy.	19	edl9le2
Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.	11	ee81l5r
Thank [NAME] there wasn't a psychologist among the testers	23	ef3gbyi
Nutter is a great word for it. I haven't even gotten into her claim that she is psychic yet. That's a story for another day.	22	ednx6nc
Dude my brother just paid $300 for an ounce, can’t wait for legalisation	13	ef08epk
He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!	16	ef9u23n
It seems like good advice.	5	ed1ediy
Good [NAME] we look horrible	11	eehtrn2
Whhhattttt. That’s crazy!!!	13	eevqdao
Testing it out in creative it feels like the hunting rifle got a huge buff this patch, cant wait to bring out one of my favorite weapons 	13	ee4et6e
And now I regret not applying when they opened one in my town even more now. Good times.	24	eepekg2
If nothing was said and you can be engaged all day tomorrow then I wouldn’t worry.	19	ef83h3z
Only until security finds it stuffed with coke.	22	edy6hcn
I always wondered why that never happened with the “muscles from Brussels” in any of his movies.	26	ef8kjjd
Keeping the stomach warm also helps. Holding the baby with their stomach against yours helps them fall asleep. But it doesn't work all the time unfortunately.	5	ed2rfl3
Of course! Happy cake day 🎂🎉	13	ef603fd
The guilt of sin represses all	24	eenfv47
 No way, man. We're gonna keep on rockin' forever. Forever. Forever. Forever...	13	edq7po0
oh my gooooood	26	ednzlou
I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick.	9	efa65s0
I was streaming on my laptop so I could watch the glorious win. Sadly hunting has been tough so far. Damn those Bison.	9	edf1o7f
Yeah, it's disgusting & I'm so disturbed by everything going on. Never ever would I have believed this is where people were headed. 	11	eczvruc
Rejection always hurts, even just a little. Sparing her feelings may mean she doesn't get the meaning. Be direct, kind, but direct. 	9	ed2napa
Oh really? I didn’t know someone else posted it haha Edit: just looked and someone posted it right after me	26	ef3n02b
I can't believe he told that story. I'm sure the minister that released the water is now so totally regretting not asking for a bj!	26	efapeti
I'm glad you're feeling better! Keep smiling :)	5	edfnx43
But when you do, just remember that trick so you don’t have to take your break or get an RI. 	5	edy2fxy
Stranger things have happened.	26	eeoi73o
There is a surprisingly large number of [NAME] who play.	26	ee7j0l8
Oh hey that's pretty cool!	13	ee2iyp3
I'd say we should dump him somewhere at sea but the oceans are already pretty polluted... :(	9	efdttia
Same! Protect yourself as much as you can. I also clean the phone and the case :D	5	ee1gsy9
Oh I never knew you could do that	26	edg7ifc
Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me	14	edux14a
That’s part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women	11	eewtejb
Intentionally frightening the Queen is an indictable offence. (Max 14 years) Criminal Code	19	ef5ciit
"I'm more concerned that the kid's name is ""[NAME]""."	5	edu0wie
It looks like someone screwed up.	9	eegeuxj
Wow! You are close to me in age. I would never do that.	26	eedlji7
No joke. Physics or chemistry I can see but comp 101? I’m surprised he has the ability to find the internet	26	eeejylf
Well then outlive your enemy, get pass your old self that is the enemy and you can outlive the enemy	5	eenc6wx
I’m worried about [NAME] too	14	eeck3gr
Reality is often disappointing -TPUSA, probably 	9	edtf8mk
In America this guy would have been shot before he entered the door	22	eexwfnu
If they're not spending this year on [NAME] or [NAME], I have no faith for them to spend on big free agents in the near future	9	ee5zgpw
Exciting finish here.	13	eegwceq
It is. I mean official translation is coming every 7 days, but leaks go day before (Korean)	22	eexjgxn
Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.	26	eee94se
I’m sorry. But, keep your respectability politics to yourself	24	eeki3gc
The stressors of the hotel industry are much the same as a restaurant. It doesn't appeal to me	22	eet9pkc
[NAME] damn you're toxic asf	11	eemi7oy
oh my [NAME] easily one of the worst sounds aaahhhhhh	26	ee4j4gh
I wish this was animated.	8	ef61oot
I wish. Chalk it up to a brain fart	8	ee0oizz
What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it.	26	ef139nt

And Meteor Man Edit: Hancock was a superhero movie too even though it was terrible.	11	eeqk5n7
that's horrifying	14	eeqgxec
Okay then. It sounds like you have it all figured out. Good luck.	5	ef2ck7s
Poor wee thing is probably terrified somewhere.	14	ef60d6q
This offseason has been so upsetting	9	edrn70e
I wanted Dallas to win today so they could lose next week. I don’t want LA anywhere near the Super Bowl.	8	edyjwba
I can’t tell who’s wooshing who but I’m afraid to ask by this point	14	ed27ia1
Actually pretty surprised that they made it fit as well as this.	26	ee5xutm
Too hungry for that money.	22	ef7fgha
Seeing [NAME] score on them was unbelievable. How embarrassing!	12	ee3hl5g
Please kind sir may I have some more	8	ef6xp3v
the screw i need is different than what they sell. we tried.	22	ed3rkhb
Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that.	11	eebbk97
Don't let your high expectations of government disappoint you.	9	eei8gib

I repent. I repent. Oh [NAME] [NAME], I do repent.	24	edlzwrl
Finally figured out who these two remind me of	22	ef4e9fz

Oh man, good luck man. Stay strong!	5	eeq7k9b
Wow 40 years at 18 wow how unfortunate.	26	ee481lp
I realised that baby [NAME] looked like young [NAME] and it really upset me. So you all have to deal with that now too.	22	eepazfz
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.	11	edp9ew4
There’s a weird [NAME] version of this where the person falls and finds [NAME]	11	ed1ph6f
1) I think my least favorite thing our kid has done would be spit up in my mouth. 2) Vomit is worse than spit up	11	ee3k68g

Wow, I wouldn’t doubt that at all. What a crazy situation! Poor woman!! 	13	ee78esm

Anyone else not like optics logo this year. The 2 greens look awful	11	eelhjy7

I wish the theme was still larger than life but their outfit prompt was fetish/bdsm wear and that they all posed next to giant sex toys	8	eee4iaq
I didn't know [NAME] was a [NAME] Lord.	22	efbgtet

Careful, he's a hero	5	edouxzw
That was the chillest Sharks GDT against an Eastern Conference team in a while.	22	ee6dv3m
At first I thought this was talking about physical piracy (like stealing cargo ships) but now I understand.	22	ef6qj8f
I really can't imagine someone saying that if the gender was reversed.	26	eexbw3k
[NAME] gets punched in the head and gets a penalty.	9	ee3b85p
Totally and sorry for that	24	ed8lu3b
At least they didn’t destroy the shoes	23	efhbm9j
Wow, the menacing head shake...(shivers) 	26	eegxo2e
You’re an awful troll...	11	eeo7rbv
Because a thought can qualify as racist without intention of effect in the same way that a thought can be transphobic without intention or effect.	22	ed906wm
Yes! And the one who embarrasses you by dancing and singing in the car while she's driving you and your friends home.	12	ef80isc
Oooooffff. That's real awkward, but I mean that somehow still ended better than I expected so.. Kudos ig??	12	edy8ze9
I care too much about what others think. Constantly trying to cater to their feelings or worrying about their opinions.	5	ef9yd9k
I really wish my husband could get his sleeping disorder under control.	8	eejc55i
Sorry, should have searched for the artist's name. Karma Decay is a lot less reliable than I thought it was.	24	ef74sqr

Sorry, there was a little bitterness in my voice from how my father treated me. Not directed at OP. I am in the wrong. 	24	ed9ngnf
I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot.	9	ee5midq
The finest example of an egotistical, ignorant and racist piece of trash. Humans like this disgust me.	11	edh38br
It took me 14 years to secure my AA 🐢	22	eec8o7h

If you've got a problem with [NAME], then you've got a problem with me and I suggest you let that one marinate	5	eel76qe
You would be better off to do some makeup tutorials. Save yourself the headache of dealing with hormones that you don't actually need.	5	ed2jjbh

In the right photo, he looks like my friend's husband.	22	eena01j

No faith! Shame!	12	ee60q8u
This was driving me NUTS!	13	eefylsk

That creepy realization that everything [NAME] says is projection...	22	eea715e

Have a good one, mate. I wish you all the loves. Here, a potcoin for you.	8	eczdx1e
OP inserted the F into “of” to make “off” and now it’s truly upsetting.	9	edzd4vb
"Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."	11	ef7l7v0
Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I’ll write home with pen and paper	26	ef8ffwu
That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence.	26	eetz567
I would agree. It's unfortunate and brutal in its content and in the responses in the thread	11	eeo75zs

Yes, I realize that. All my other relationships have been a year or longer but even a month into those I was miserable 	22	edmy9hn
Nah. Been over it pretty much since [NAME] said the Vikings did it too. Pretty hard to be mad when we were just as guilty.	24	ee5r309

Sorry, I just got to give you an extra upvote for 'twat waffle'. It really sums it up marvellously. 	24	edqznah

I used to build a ramp and jump over other kids on my bike ala [NAME]... I was amazed at the time.	26	ecztf18

It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.	11	edtw3vd
Happy real life cake day my dude :)	13	efh95ub
Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous.	11	effblm3
Too bad it wasn’t a sword.	9	edexsoz
Exactly, I've seen some of her friends and family SM and is not exactly wowing me. 	9	eek8nlq
Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard	24	efdtorq
Why am I excited for the new season	13	eel2tan
She probably just said it because it rhymes, sorry Op	24	eeo35oc
Yeah I remember when they banned bathrooms, crazy thing. 	22	ee0x3le
At least my suffering is over.	23	edb93xt
It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.	11	edcobri
Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too	9	edzsedj
Given [NAME] viability prior to the 2016 election, I think the viability bar is set pretty damn low.	9	ee1rluu
Once you pop, you can’t stop Wait a minute...	22	edrui0z
Let's watch impractical jokers!	8	eewaqo7
I hope [NAME] bullies wittle baby [NAME] tonight, like he did last year!	8	ef7dtcw
And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!	11	edx4np7
Underrated comment.	11	eeneopw
If it's legal where you live, then it doesn't really matter what anyone thinks.	5	ee8dvm2
I wanna see [NAME] get in [NAME] face like this	8	edj16xd
Mmm ... Chicken milk.	13	ee331lx
All these soldiers taking a load of their feet... I feel ashamed for my homeland !!	12	eel5s8k
My pride. I'm like a roach, unsightly to look at but determined to survive 	21	edecg28
I actually did have a girl a few towns away in a different school and no one knew her. No one believed me at first :(	9	ee1uit6
Wow. In real time we have it in action. You lack any degree of self awareness.	13	eddvia6
Points. I envy your luck! My matches generally range from 10k-29k :/	8	ef68ii6
I am so relieved	23	eer3ohm
I do know a few fellows who didn't get accepted until a full month after. Just chill until then. Good luck!	5	eermhni
Goddamn I’m excited about this football team!	13	ed8zwph
Ok this actually happened to me when I was one bloodthirsty away from getting gold on my MX9	22	edvcj44
But hey, at least it saves us the trouble of contacting them!	23	eeaqei7
I sleep alone on the floor. That was a bad idea...	24	ecziz4m
"I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."	14	eds3i3o
Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.	19	eetjm9k
Damn I was about to go out tonight.	9	eewn9w1
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]	14	eewv2x1
That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.	11	ee7xp7i
I feel so guilty that this picture exists. I feel like I need to donate to charity after this.	24	efcpbe0
I'm too scared to start Black Mirror because it honestly seems like we might not be that far off from some of it.	14	ed82vnh
You must be new to character ranking threads if you think I'm *genuinely* upset at some random person's worthless opinions.	5	edau374
My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes 	24	efarbiv
I worry that as soon as VR and AR take off, it'll be the nail in the coffin and we will be trapped.	19	eel1j5c
You guys will be shocked to know it is another cut of the Ga Spa vid.	26	eetkjzt
My bad if I just leaked /u/keypuncher and /u/ibiteyou 's Christmas card photo...	24	ee5v1je
Sorry, the two different names made me thing those were two different places. ^ ^;	24	ef7sxew
[NAME] got used to be my favorite character. This is embarrassing beyond any stretch of the imagination.	12	ee4fchx
Self confidence I think and the fact that I’m scared if I do give all of myself to some that they won’t reciprocate.	14	ee632bg
She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life.	14	edcktsz
It’s misleading. Better article:	9	ed5l0tn
Ah. My misunderstanding. Yeah get rid of those but that isn't what the removed post was.	22	ee38yjo
But doing those things makes me feel so.... icky.	9	eds9dho
Yikes. She sounds like she's one bad grade away from shooting up a synagogue.	11	ed0hg0n
[NAME] has a drive that [NAME] doesn't at all. He cares more about his hair than buying a house for his mom from what I have seen.	5	ef33eln
OMG!!	26	edr0ryr
WHAT A DISGUSTING START	11	ed6yg6i
Basically how I discovered I’m bi—	22	edy9mpa
Eh happiness is just a fleeting fish in an ocean of emotion. You can catch it a few times but dont expect to live off it.	5	ed8o487
I wonder if Belpedio will get a chance up here at some point.	26	ed2yu52
Huh. Didnt know the HD edition had online multiplayer.	22	edla0hj
Well, my masochistic curiosity got the better of me. I've seen worse, but that's going on the blacklist for damn sure.	22	edtsmxa
I joined the casuals on the couch and curled up in horror while watching this	14	eenuouw
She was HOPING she was gone!	8	eeeoavh
How scary! She loves you! I hope you are ok.	14	edbr0a7
Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos.	12	ee7ikjz
Sorry to burst your bubble, but winners write history and since leave won ... */dodges incoming tomato*	24	ef647m3
Wow, I wish we had info on which counties have it the worst. Was that in the article?	8	eezs293
Even if she was 25 this would have been weird and creepy af.	12	edenih5
Praying for you to find peace soon, man. 	5	eewfwhh
Don't forget the part where [NAME] doubts himself or goes off on his own and fails. Then [NAME] tells him how much she loves him and to run	5	ee692im
I get your point. But really, the low prices is just a trap to get more men in lookout for action. It's sad.	9	eewgn4z
Except you continue to lose calories well after you finish running...so way off	22	ed0o4rs
Wow [NAME] retained NO combat skills from the time he was [NAME] to help him fight Cicada at that bar	26	eeqvjpj
Careful, it's hot 	5	ed17kef
Why did she get married if she did not love him? Aren't you afraid the same thing wil happen to you?	14	eeyx89b
I don’t know who [NAME] is and, at this point, I’m too afraid to ask.	14	ee5nn34
I use one every time I park and you just replied to me. so this is a bit awkward.	12	edknmyz
Oh don’t worry, I have an oil for that	5	ed7u4jb
[NAME] combat is terrible and the only reason I don’t play it anymore	14	ed23i73
Beyond nightmare!!	14	eehsg7q
Ah, info not previously known. Knowing that, I probably would’ve done the same. 	22	edqpjb5
I was eating watching tonight's episode. OMG I never will again. You all know what I mean. The opening scene!!!	26	edot3om
I can’t believe he’s playing the live action sonic the hedgehog	26	ee8w41w
That escalated quickly.	22	edoa90h
Calm down kid jeez	5	ed339uc
I wish I could buy them I am here in Florida gets harder each day to find them	8	eeq2i0t
Wish I had something better for you but best of luck to you, this situation sucks 	8	edjkk75
That sounds really interesting.	13	eeyibw0
I have seen some terrible minion stuff, I thought I've seen the worst of the worst. I was wrong...I was horribly wrong.	11	ee23cii
SATURDAY! SATURDAY! SATURDAY!	13	edd24f6
I wish I could give it to you. I've always had negative comments.	8	eesk255
I TOOK TOO MUCH OF A RISK IM SORRY	24	edoh4m2
Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them..	26	eex6qhu
Her upper lip always looks terrible - such an easy fix, can’t believe she is so vain and never bothers to wax 	12	edgsfqv
Wow, foot and car traffic downtown has changed a ton in just 8 years. 	26	eer4vq0
Those are some pissed off lookin Nucks	11	ee9360m
I didnt even recognize [NAME]!!!	26	edevzk6
She sounds hideous.	11	ed4whhd
The same comedy bit [NAME] has disavowed because it's used almost exclusively in circumstances like this? It's an awful and weak explantation.	9	ed3a9hg
I'm surprised they've gone this long not knowing [NAME] swears a lot.	26	eczkjtx
Him being in prison (if these useless people and their story is real) HIV and Hep C should be a concern for her.	5	ef8nlci
Yo creep, please get help!	5	edboetl
Get well soon, my man! Keep representing la isla! 🇵🇷	5	ee1xd1x
Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror	14	ef9hm8g
Happy Birthday!!	13	eei4b7a
I'm so triggered!!!!!!! Please stop you are hurting us with your comments!?!?!?!?!?	9	effq7j4
Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. 😂	14	eeeesmd
It’s a shame we have to face the islanders so soon	12	edevj3j
I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.	26	ef9qttf
Or, [NAME] is upset we aren't in the playoffs.... You know. He only really cares about winning ..	5	ed1cj03
Chocolate hazelnut croissants were the bomb!	13	ee3aw0f
I'm amazed people read BuzzFeed articles.	26	edaxzbt
Here we go, ya'll ready for WW3...this time we're the baddies! 	13	ee77sou
I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.	26	eeibox0
I wish that too 😢	8	eczruja
It's seriously terrifying!	14	ef5pcyk
This sent shivers down my spine	14	eew4n1x
I couldn't reply to the message I got the other day	19	eefng6q
That [NAME] part killed me!	9	edkl352
I'm surprised he didn't say it was *almost* an inside job	26	edrtu7n
It’s pretty embarrassing to see a grown man be taken down by a dog when the man outweighs the dog by a lot lmfao	12	eelonh3
The biggest cringe is actually all the people commenting she's a man	14	ef2xue2
There are worse things!!!:	11	eexhwdo
21 year old here! I had always wondered when I would feel like an adult... according to this thread looks like it never happens	26	edjmw3k
Just take it easy son.	5	eezgs86
I’m sorry on behalf of all the idiot guys. They didn’t take my class. How Not to be Creepy 101.	24	ee6fvcu
Yep. Lots of younger generation are obsessed with their phones and emotionally rocky tend to engage in this behavior, especially women with their whole Instagram obsessions.	9	edu177n
League wants an LA team to finally work so bad	9	eem75s7
It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.	9	ee3edgb
I wonder if it's a deal issue and they are allowed, again, to slip away in the last minute.	26	eem9uua
Well I'm scared as shit let's hope for the best, benz should be back(?)	14	eefiwf7
I cant’t stand mint flavored toothpaste. That’s how much I hate mint.	11	ef323i6
Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?! 	26	edfxx6i
Considering that the majority of people who play poker still open limp, I'm surprised these posts aren't more common.	26	eenxbj4
I only watched a few episodes, but I loved that guy.	13	eeclkzp
Omg I had to crank my tv because I thought it was just low volume	26	eeok334

I wish I could forget	8	eduzcmr
He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He’s an awful person	11	eersl7f
Whenever I have felt it would work. I wasn't always right but it never hurt to ask.	9	edufbf2
Yea! But I realize now I was referring to the wrong movie.	22	efcy04t
Well sure his one appearance in relief lost us a game, but at least he didn’t get hurt. 	23	edtx2wi
Only 22? Weak.	19	ef1j1r7
I see why magic fans want [NAME] off their team.	22	eetdjlx
[NAME] clan needs some fucking therapy.	11	ed9au26
Be careful with this weed	5	eeo49t5
That helps. I would've never guessed you'd style mannequins.	26	ed1rvol
It could be how depression is effecting you but i don't think it's crazy	5	eelq38h
Im so hype for this game, ive been waiting for this for awhile	13	edhulzt
Uh oh. Ummm, I need to take care of something.	5	eezu6ty
Good deeds don't buy off being shitty. This is why [NAME] is remembered as a monster.	9	edb7ryn
Today I saved lots and lots of people from being raped by me. Now I really *do* feel created in [NAME] image.	21	eebeduu
im surprised you didnt try to go over her head to the owner or did he just not care about what the new GM was doing?	26	ed00251
😂 I get excited when I see a profile OLD for a state employee.	13	edjovry
I'm worried he's too small. I love his quickness, but sub-170 is scary for a guy that'll be running over the middle.	19	ed720ui
Arghh! There's a dinosaur loose in your house! A dinosaur with Tippex eyes.	14	eech0ur

Jurassic world fallen kingdom was awful after they left the island	11	eeax6cr
Just got back,amd I realized that The Ducks are getting clutterfuckedd	22	eekbt52
Pure unadulterated hatred. It’s disgusting.	11	efbbc4t
those pictures of [NAME] are real, he's on Crashing and the way he looked in the premiere was just awful.	11	eeupzsu
And that is what cognitive dissonance looks like. People do the craziest things when reality doesn't meet their expectations.	13	edmcyru
My god, what is WRONG with people? So glad you’re okay, OP!!	23	eeoo6mi
Stafford Starford Starlord OMG!!!	13	edxu7cm

I've learned that guys are dumb and to not listen to them about women's beauty stuff🙄	22	eekvphp
Waiting must be really boring	9	eeo4v2x
It's an underrated drama which just got snubbed on [NAME]	9	edhildf
I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.	14	ee972co
Wish a cute girl would stare at me.	8	ee10zff
Sorry for your loss. Thoughts and prayers.	24	ee65vbi
I dated a girl once who made a gb with her cup holder. Dropped my phone in it once	12	edb830c
This is more what I was looking for, that’s how I figured it’d feel but I’m not super eager to find out 	13	eel3hih
That trade turned out to be a complete disaster for us. Too bad.	9	edq3cb1
I’m scared for y’all saying Undone.	14	eegqyrq
Her attempts to be “edgy” fall flat are incredibly cringeworthy.	12	ee6svq3
This wouldn’t feel so bad if sales and footfall weren’t but many external pressures were keeping profits down.	9	edp7aw5
Ooooh, we got a badass over here!	13	efdnxo4
That is one of the things I’m most excited for in S2. Seeing him playing [NAME] and go off like this so effortlessly is amazing	13	ee5y25t
I'm interested, more than I should be.	13	eelrkir
Having kids is bringing into being a conscious person who will suffer and die and be aware of that fact. Become an antinatalist.	22	ee6aac6
Teacher: Huh, I never though he'd really do that.	9	eetonhn
I’m surprised I had to scroll this far down	26	eesy9j8
"My first thought was, ""What is a [NAME]?"" Then I realized I was being dumb."	22	ed8evtz
Ooo, I wouldn't go that far.	22	edhf3tb
this 'bug' has caused me countless death... i always used rifle primarily and switched to shotgun after rifle shot	9	ef3vu80

"""I awoke several hours later in a daze...."" 😂"	22	eej7h6s
That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. 	14	eef8et1
The snapchat news feed on the stories page is horrendous, its entirely just celebs, porn and hookup culture shit. 	11	edszrxl
I wonder how it's still tagged questionable...	26	ef5swm9
I can’t believe you’re comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.	11	ee2tkqb
She completely understands, that's why she does this.	22	eeeta4b
This comment completly proves the opinion of the OP right lmao. I’m so sorry America doesn’t meet your standards oh mighty reddit commentor	24	ee0famc
Stay safe, you will find someone one day. 	5	eda9v6q
I'm sorry but [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are my favs this year (and I hated [NAME] in her Season).	24	eecgc6p
I'm with you. Would this news surprise me? Absolutely not. But I'm not believing anything regarding this subject unless it comes from [NAME] himself	26	eecs4a5

I'm sorry, there is no way this guy is Canadian.	24	edf01o7
I suggest that you start by not apologising before you do something harmless (e.g. the beginning of this thread)	5	ef34r10
I’m not much into either, but I have my share of stupid desires. I really want more mermaid tails.	8	ed4bi0f

I forgot i followed this subreddit and now i'm having a meltdown	9	efgddqt
The original Halloween movie is still the scariest film I have ever seen. Being chased by [NAME] in this game is terrifying.	14	ed37yew
What an unbelievable coward	26	eebu7wh
I’m scared.	14	ef6m6nf
Sorry but I don't keep up with YT celebs or drama What happened to [NAME] ?	24	eczku6u
It only struggles because it's released too late by [NAME] defeat.	22	eefovtz
Sometimes people that are around each other a lot just get to be friends. Sometimes people ignore that their friends are actually terrible people.	11	eebf5f1
Well, I was going to surprise you [NAME], but what the heck...I’m gaining a bunch of weight to go on disability!	9	edv5qc5
Is that seriously the story? I haven’t googled it. I just thought it was cool as a WW2 buff	26	eduzvf5
I don’t even try to make shots like this myself. So I gotta watch other people make them.	12	ee1vqbb
Don't feel bad I am sure the otters are getting taken care care of just fine.	5	ee9urkz
And I thought I was too old for this drama (I’m 25)	22	eena18z
I isst thought y’all woooshed me but then I realized what subreddit I’m on	22	ed8ale8
It was more just “where did all these airpods come from?!” It was weird to me.	26	eexlt23

Katy/cypress area is just as bad if not worse in some areas. Luckily we only saw one driver obviously drunk but there were several wrecks. Be safe everyone	5	ed06i70
This is why you either keep your distance or shoot them.	22	ed5673i
She might just be insecure. You do have a bit of an age difference, so she might feel like she doesn’t match up to you.	9	eeenzor
very interesting hill to die on	13	ef8wcwl
We *do* deserve animals if we give them lovings! Don’t talk so down about yourself, silly .. that’s what that kitty would say !	5	eea6o52

My baby niece does this. She fell down a couple stairs in her time and now is real careful with them	22	edo15zf

Sorry, mom took it out of the oven already and I am STARVING!	5	ef64v0v
I have this too, so don't worry. We are not crazy. Just regular humans who happen to have an anxiety issue. 	19	eenv6nx
I've wondered this too!	13	ef4jwl4
Yes, because private matches are a thing. Surprised no one else has mentioned that one.	26	ee32iu1
Disgusting. Truly disgusting.	11	efbuvez
Happy new year!	13	ed2rpue

If it also ends up with them meeting [NAME] 4 horsewomen pals ([NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]), that'll be interesting.	13	edjaunx
You're not the only one. I for one feel stupid for thinking 100t shouldnt be having problems with such an easy pool	12	eeld9ug
Good thing he throws like a 6 year old girl, otherwise this could've been serious. 	23	ef4lh8i
True dat, I lost hope a LONG time ago	9	eeuddja

Happy birthday! Enjoy your day and [NAME] should close this out as a present :)	13	eecj0g3
Understanding of human nature has. Believe it or not, people thousands of years ago might not have understood the world perfectly.	22	ed1if2q
Me, too. Was shocked to say the least.	26	edz79om
Now this is poke choking!	11	eczbfxj

Of all the people in the world, I honestly can't believe that Reddit hates [NAME].	26	ef6b87x
It doesn't matter if 99% didn't vote for him, it only maters that he got 50% +1 of the seats.	22	ee4zhjz

this comment made me very nervous	19	ef6tm8u
Oh [NAME], even if I had a bf I would be ashamed to have him do that for 	12	ede6r04
Pretty much, it’s ironic to think how quickly the parties would switch positions if the illegal immigrants were expected to vote 90% for [NAME].	9	edojj1u
I almost didn't finish this stranger mission because I just *knew* it was going to be bad.	9	ed2wypf
He probably just doesn't want to hurt the ex's feelings. But if you're concerned, ask him yourself if things are only okay	5	edn25cv
People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr	22	edzmlum

I was just a little disappointed that there is no audible/visible reaction by the character when visiting the graves (also trying to avoid spoilers).	9	eds6o2p
Opposite reaction to the right trying to demonize her. The obsession with her from the right is insane.	22	eeq378j
Nah, reviewable offsides is pretty bad	9	edffnpq
I totally have second-hand embarrassment for my parents. It's equally bad when they misspell something in their email address (i.e: posion instead of poison) 🙄	12	edk4dkb

Lol I wish	8	ee2957c

"[NAME] I hate bad mondays at work! He needs to fiind a new job, this one is full of ”bad clients""..."	9	edhmde5
I'm actually surprised none of his wives have stabbed him in his sleep already. Now he has secret service protection 😋	26	eeqamx0
I haven't seen a sign like that on mine. Not that it would carry the force of law, anyway, in Florida.	26	edkcqsy
[NAME] didn't finish the LPs!? Wow. I am in episode 20 something and was expecting him to finish :(	26	eemrwye
This is what it's like to have a heart attack in the Cars universe.	22	ef7i1bf

Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.	8	eeumroh
Don't worry looking for it, there isn't any porn tab/hidden message	5	eensbs3

Let it flow through you, become empowered by it. 	5	eesla4l
She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy. 	5	edaa2vj
Unfortunately not but I loved the saxy section and would love to see it again!	13	edxo1s2
It’s amazing.	13	edw7b8p

My husband gets very prudish anytime kids are anywhere. EVEN in our locked bedroom.	9	eefpwep

Oh hey, someone with a brain. Rare round here. 	22	ef23x9m
Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. 	9	eeah41k
I read your story earlier today. Hun I'm here for you too. Pm me if you need.	5	ed3eux5
I dont disagree with taking the first steps, I just wish we would be even more ambitious. 	8	ef1hfz1
That’s nuts about the digging. I wish we had better dog boots that fit them more naturally than what we have.	8	ef7xk7p
I still can't believe that dude in Whangarei is still allowed to run his business. I wonder how much longer he will keep it up.	26	ee1mlra
Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??	26	ef8fpph
Might as well do something while you're doing nothing!	5	ee1zeyc
You need professional help for that level of paranoia.	5	eent75p
I gotta say, that was a WELL fought period. I was worried a couple times...	19	ee5xx4i
It's back up now. Sorry for the mess with moderation, wasn't our fault.	24	ed5c4fo
Alright, so I googled aaaaaaand sorry for my misinformed mistake. Dunno where I heard that [NAME] didn't win the popular vote but it was wrong :(	24	edacujg
I wonder if, as an added bonus, [NAME] ended the cameo with a dic pic. 	26	ee76art
Oh sorry I didn’t realize that journalists weren’t actually autonomous humans that can think for themselves.	24	ee4sa44

Hell yeah! I can't wait for the rust to break off and for people to be as excited as they were years ago.	13	ef12vos

It's not something i'm proud of, but I definitely fucked up that day.	11	edh3jat
Okay, carry on then. Just thought I’d make sure you recognized that there was a difference.	22	eev575g
I'll admit that's a bit surprising, since it's such a massive international hub. But beggars can't be choosers I guess. 	26	ede3rws
Because Im going to feel sorry for the death of someone who assaulted me. Sure thing buddy.	24	ef75ws3
Once it became clear I was too old to have a family, yeah, it felt too old to bother with it.	22	eda6q6t
Did I say he was a scammer? I said he's disgusting and there's nothing endearing about him at all. Not surprised this subreddit is defending him	11	ed8u8zc
I wish I could be this person.	8	efd8hvi
I’m going to bed nowish, hope you’re ok. HMU if you want.	5	ee9qgro
Good for you!	5	ef2mvxo

[NAME] is pretty fucking scary	14	edrvloi
I'd be a lot more excited to see [NAME] flash the leather at 3b.	13	ee5bdw6
You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.	11	edvwgyx
Havent been working for 10 years at this company about 5 now, but i have overall 10 years experience	21	efc4z80

We’ve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn’t rise to the level we warned him about.	9	ed9wp84
I remember being 4 and so excited to help pair the socks after they were dried. Kids love being involved.	13	eerbv0c
I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This terrifies me.	14	edfjjk2
I'm excited for [NAME]/ [NAME] moments. My flair(s)	13	eeh08oe
Me too! I got scared that I've been laundry inpaired my whole life and never even realized it!	14	edgawvb
Oh my god.... They used [NAME] voice!	26	edw5hse
Just don’t feel bad. It’s their fault for taking it personally	5	ed5rfsq
Not as excited anymore about having the most difficult second half in the NHL...	9	ee6c7t8
sorry fam, but this is a repost on this sub as well.	24	edl0s5y
I was impressed by your company in the initial post, but now I see they tried to fire you for their mistake. Glad you had some backing!	22	ef9lqkg
I know, this weekend was absolute worse case scenario 	9	eenutox
Anyone who needs to get off, please use the Ashton Taper. Message for support, I’m here. 	5	eeg06oj
You’re not alone OP. Stay strong. It’s rough now but everything will be back to normal soon.	5	edf5q4c
I thought that said affordable, and i was really concerned	5	ee9onca
My brah, [NAME] on the line up! Fuck yeah!	13	efa6bxw
As far as I'm concerned, [NAME] run for the WH ended with this twisted ankle.	5	edeh7a0
Calm down. It's a real concept.	5	ee4197n
You have nothing to feel bad about. It sounds like he needs to grow up and start paying his way.	5	eeoocug
No worries. We just like to make sure everyone is safe and has a voice.	5	ef2i4dt
O no shes gonna go after mandy	9	ef53bbj
Damn I wish I we're friends with [NAME]. I could use 197k	8	edw1hiy
Whoa this is really creepy	11	ee05ddd
Your mental health matters the most. You can't help him more than you do, but you can help yourself. 	5	edfoz0d
I hope mcd's charged extra for the sauce.	8	ee3ou2t
I still wish if we get a deeper face customization like in RPGs.	8	edrujye
Simon's or the bay. [NAME] makes some merino ones that are unbelievable. They are not cheap though.	26	eef808o
Oh baby a triple!	26	eeranlm
It boggles my mind every day how easily conspiracy theorist stuck their flag in Trumpland.	26	ef4ehx6
His interviews are so awkward	12	ee3raie
Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.	11	ef0zs2h
Pleasure. I hope you find the virtues you are seeking in life my friend.	5	eexxql3
Oooooow check it out, HIRED guy. *fist bump*	13	efgx9sg
Makes sense but honestly the FO needs to accept they drafted wrong and just trade for DSJ for the sake of the team	8	ee5hjsc
You are not wrong. I have learned about myself alot while on drugs. Sometimes it's scarry when i find out how limited my mind is.	14	eerekx1
That’s no ordinary rabbit!	22	eef3yal
I remember being a kid and everything I did was haraam like even looking at people was haraam :/	22	ee1vnzi
The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.	9	eeocrjq
that looks like a nightmare.	14	eeayv2k
I think my mom is similar but I feel like I make things worse by trying to explain myself.	22	edzaf2c
2017's sky high fees proved that this tech fails on a large scale. It's a disappointing reality.	9	ee7n81v
That’s beyond disgusting in every way.	11	eeou6h5
Please come and visit again soon! Have a safe flight!	5	eeovi8o
No. Spend all of it ASAP. Spend the evidence so you can get rid of it quickly and safely while also still being able to buy shit!	5	eexcpmo
Never thought of that. Now i dislike Heaven more than before.	9	ee4wlkp
They’re honestly a cult at this point. It’s not just sad, but incredibly scary.	14	ed0vi9o
It's not murder if he wants to die, it's euthanasia. She doesn't necessarily have to be the one to do it. 	22	edxd5ih
Sorry bb :( I understand that feeling all too well, haha	24	eez2guh
Thats pretty lewd.	11	ee97206
Losing my Origin account? Oh no, how else will I play thousands of other non-shitty EA games now?	9	eddaqx8
It involves a relationship with a girl so I need a girls input, sorry I’m not sexist or anything.	24	edmccpd
Day 2 Feels good, man!	23	ed3cggk
True despair.	9	ed9i9ya
The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.	14	eelo4e4
I live in America and wish I could support them but they're on the wrong coast.	8	ee9usct
Oh yes! Here's an Imgur link to the first three I saw.	13	ed76nlr
Don't be angry. Encountering toxic people in online games is common and you won't change that. Try playing single-player or games with more sophisticated community	5	ee6skpv
An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.	11	ef9arms
So we are really going to miss the playoffs in the same season as the 10 game win streak... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE !	9	ee4rux5
Must’ve gotten it the wrong way round because he moves like a spry 82 yr old	22	eeql575
Make a change make it small and manageable. Go for a walk. Smile at people.	5	ed1cmp1
Bump stocks too I guess, I can't imagine why he actually did that though, perhaps his advisors told him to do it to pander	9	efdwdnh
Meh, it’s “next man up” over there. I’ll be worried when they stop making it to the playoffs. 	19	eebmpj8
That was the first thing we tried and we could not get it to work.	9	ed0ybo6
What an obnoxious, drunk girl. 	11	ee3d2r9
Think its time you let your butterfly self out, dear....	5	efc7qh6
Haha, I wish, but not happening	8	ed7zfm7
These are some of the lamest threatening letters I’ve ever seen. She’s a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.	14	ef817z2
Oh, I felt that despondency at the end there. Poor guy. 	9	eeprh4z
Glad you're rid of me? Pretty obviously breaking the sub rules there.	9	eddhgrm
You’re dehydrated and exausted, drink lots of water and maybe get some sleep. You’ll feel better eventually.	23	eee7y95
For extra measure tape it right by your crotch so she can't take it for sexual assault reasons	5	ed9b88y
Shame. CLG [NAME] could've been a thing.	12	ed5ukmx
Yeah, you're getting points. Bring your insurance documents as well just to save yourself the trip back. They will ask for them.	5	eenngja
You can talk to me. It'll be good having someone nice around.	5	ee348ww
I know 😢 it’s one of my life’s goals to see a moose in real life despite how terrified I will be lol!!	14	eehpn6k
Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there’s concern it may push her into needing braces.	5	edt2mxr
I want to see him succeed. Mostly because his last name makes me think of the bad guy from Shrek	5	eenl5g0
Can't wait	13	eeb99lo
We got Munchak guys!	13	ee2qbrn
Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.	14	ee7zchq
Welcome to the party, pal!	13	edi7v8h
I’m actually suprised they all didn’t follow him and now they all have to repeat junior year.	26	eet96w6
It wasnt a terrible idea until [NAME] got injured and [NAME] got complacent	9	eehvvh4
I FUCKING WIN	13	ee7vv35
we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is. turns out she's actually trash.	9	edfzcco
Still pretty embarrasing though :p	12	ee4k72j
And that is simply why it is (or was) illegal. And why it was classified as a class 1 danger. MONEY.	22	eed5k92
I used to when i was younger, but then i got old and started caring about conserving water. 	5	ednohed
Oh yeah its that other chick who looked way to young to be in highschool	26	edowbqx
Damn ive been hard on brown but he's been looking like 15-16 [NAME] this game	9	edrxoaj
It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.	26	eebpm1k
What’s the clip from? I’m scared to put “teen boy good kisser 900 number” into YouTube	14	ede79xe
And a happy holiday to you.	13	eeq90fu
Oh wow. Gotta visit it one day.	13	edm4a1l
this is my worst fear	14	ee6juy3
I’m here,it’s tough but I’m here.	5	eczsn7h
Last year preseason was in December, but the season started in January. I expect pre-season to occur some time during the second half of this month.	8	ediaqmz
I think the dog is mostly worried about being fed and let outside when the last of the humans stop coming home.	5	eeoffax
It’s the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.	14	ee6ubza
Please just give [NAME] some rest. He looks tired.	5	edcgi09
Sorry, didnt realize. Anyway an r/woooosh so...	24	eec9j8l
Was gonna hit you with the /r/gatekeeping for that elitist mentality, but you recognized your errors. Props. 	22	eezx8dd
What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.	24	edlapiu
I’m surprised she didn’t name him Allesandrostien	26	eeqgxa2
It will be painful but it will be worth it! Good Luck, and may you never be a slave to a drug again !	5	ed0vy11
Oh man, I didn't expect that: It kept rolling on his face!	9	eecuz47
Holy shit this speaks to me.	26	eelor39
Oh dear [NAME]!	26	ed81e4x
Misread. I’m with you my dude.	5	ee4u7p9
I still can't believe [NAME] actually gonna be in Smash.	26	ednolcb
damn, congratulation 🤣	13	ed7wkb2
It always upset me that [NAME] would require his only son to do this I no longer believe it	9	ef43ifs
I understand this keeps many dairies afloat (source neighbourhood dairy guy, so not 100 per cent sure it’s accurate). 	22	edewrth
He drinks all coffee with cream. We already know he’s not above disgusting liquids.	11	eewdztl
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.	9	edub9tx
ah dang sorry. in that case idk.	24	eepw0xx
I feel uncomfortable how we didn’t see him resurface...	12	ee8xbjc
heh, I remember that commercial.. Was pretty cringy	12	ed7wr4n
This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.	14	ee7iess
Killing goblins is not murder hoboing. [NAME] should have done that himself, really. 	22	ed3tysd
Ha, I just saw that highlight. nasty	11	eemu96i
Get help.	5	eeyf9i6
Go spidey go!!	13	ee0kea5
I have no idea how we are down by ONLY 13. Its truly a miracle.	26	ee61x8k
I missed this. Wow that is a travesty	13	eemd0lz
what a cute outfit omg	13	edmio77
Wow what a surprise...	26	efgpnfi
Was really hoping he’d drive off with it (sigh)	8	edb8uqe
Good luck.	5	efd1p4r
Wow! This got far more real than I was anticipating.	26	ed8rswv
Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.	9	ef54dn8
NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!	14	edouv2b
No worries. Have a nice day.	5	ef33w8v
Lots of tourists like taking pictures with the locals. Don't feel so bad, OP. It's also entirely possible your father was mistaken. 	5	edee2ew
Realize that no girl is perfect for you if you're not perfect for her. I feel for your disappointment tho. Keep on truckin'.	9	ef3e1sc
A surprise to be sure! But a welcome one	26	edl03l6
He had a poor year in 2000 but a really good year in 1999 that helped the Mets make the post-season.	22	een8twr
Same. Ugh	11	eeekpbx
Well he hasn’t dont anything good ever. So sorry I’m not very excited about this trade.	24	edf34ts
It's all fun and games until somebody loses an ear.	22	ee1z91r
They do realize that the guy in the first picture is from a musical that mocks the [RELIGION] religion right?	22	edbgogf
Understandable. Retail sucks and people are nut	22	eeqcro4
Cheers mate.	13	een3wp8
Cool! Well I look dumb but I learned something	21	eewzl08
Think we need a sub dedicated to miserable reviews.	8	een5mie
I spend a lot of time worrying about how and why that'll happen to me as I get older.	19	ee2krnk
This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material	14	eed5lv6
I'm sorry to break the news to you. :(	24	eew3rud
Seeing Capital Cities live so learning to sing Chartreuse out of excitement.	13	edlwzwh
Yeah. She kills herself, but by accident. 	22	ee9r8zm
Got boarded, ejected, and ship damaged... very poor tactic.	11	ee8to3i
Damn I wish there was such a service here.	8	edufg1x
Newsflash: Ugly people cheat, too. Cheaters cheat. Cheating is a behavior, not a look. 	11	eeh2pek
You need medical help.	5	eeo7r7a
Goat sighting!!	13	ed47ez1
There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful.	11	ef4nkye
Same here, i hope my upcoming trip is gonna kill me	14	ee3lsk2
Very disappointed to find out that you can’t play NCAA football on PS4. Wack.	9	edbgls5
Please, please, please get help. 	5	eduxmna
"The fact that this podcast isn't called ""Z-Targeting Dio's Balls"" disappoints me greatly."	9	ef9u2jy
First I was afraid, I was petrified...	14	ef0twwy
Don’t fall for it.	5	eeig438
Sorry, not from her. But from family and friends. We were open to each other about everything.	24	eebwrsp
Sorry, but this was already on our front page recently, so I'm gonna have to remove it. 	24	ef587ik
if its not obvious everyone is having issues with this scam site	22	ee9azj3
😥 I feel so sorry. He'd be proud of you. *Hugs*	24	ed9acqh
I’ve lived in Florida. Hurricanes are *much* worse.	11	ef848ee
Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!	26	ee9dd79
Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it.	26	efd4rom
4-25 against teams with winning records. 0-7 on Monday Night Football. The guy can't show up when it matters.	9	ed3g5b9
I missed this villain of the week feel of the show. Feels reminiscent of S1 and S2.	9	ef80qp1
Wtf Powerhouse Macomb is the gym I go to. I've never seen this dude there.	26	ed77yvz
Would love to see her back but not a chance in hell until the series finale, if that.	8	ed2zjz4
Omg creepy!	14	edhgdhn
Sorry pal but your just England’s b team	24	efdmxv2
Mine was the size of my pinky. And honestly get any size you want! Just be mindful of your pain tolerance	5	eenu7pa
I personally like [NAME] and think he could be on the team right now, but the Org doesn't agree.	9	eczdzjj
Seeing happy people isn't motivating because it shows how easy it is and how I'm failing at something literally everyone else on the planet can do	9	ed0d72m
More worried about the multi-trillion dollars in entitlement programs than 5$ on a wall.	19	edi3q1q
You have to try really hard to get banned on this sub.	5	eepg3ia
Oh boy I was wide awake when I lost my under 51.5. [NAME] can go fuck his ugly self	11	edz2bc6
Woooooooooo it took long enough but the UYU boys finally did it and made the league	13	eegum9w
[NAME], Big Bang Theory is terrible so glad it's going to be gone.	23	eek7x6k
Shit she doesn’t want = “curated beauty box” 🤔	9	edff3kj
The poor dude.....pray for him.	5	efemr5n
Go take care of your boy up top of this chain, then we'll talk.	5	ed3ekby
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.	9	eczb4bm
My arms only seem small because my love handles are so big	5	een8l19
yep. Sucks don't it? You can't do anything about it now, and nobody cares. 	9	eenyrv0
The one in WA state. For some reason Vancouver BC is really close to Vancouver WA. It's weird	11	ee0kq94
Because no one in this world wants to see you happy and satisfied man!	22	ef9xxmb
The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.	11	ee0o0zt
Be careful with this. This is the same rationale lots of people used to hate on the Covington students.	5	effx5q9
So how depressing is it that I know that's not true? You still gotta pay for a cold delivery.	9	ed8ex6k
And even worse after 40 years!	11	ee58og8
That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.	14	edqgi71
Would be interesting to see a referendum where only UKIP and Lib Dem members vote.	13	ee5mw8k
You seem jealous	22	eddb635
No problem! I was upset I couldn’t chose a female rose grey bay Arabian in story mode. I wanted to name her Rosé	9	edg5g9z
Let's wait till BFV leaves alpha before we plan the next one. But seriously, that would be a great setting.	8	eedgd6y
Whatever happens, you will survive this. Keep your head up brother ✊	5	ee9tnic
[NAME] get him a glass of water and have him lie down...	5	ed2urjd
At least she's not a dirty little hamster.	23	eehlk6v
Ketamine is absolutely bizarre in high doses. I lack the words to really describe it. I've never felt so detatched from my own humanity.	9	eebgdpa
i wish i wasn’t a failure of a person.	8	eefngwh
[NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....	14	edm2lzb
"""PPG Paints"" arena or whatever it's called now is worse"	9	ee2s41x
Wow, are you me? No one is a fan of season 1 but I definitely do this. There are little gems despite [NAME].	26	ef4ixny
Same! Makes me want to hug them and feed them milk.	5	edn5edr
And you wonder why Labour get's a bad name for anti-Semitism with statements like that. Ok hun.	26	ee1pg15
Yasssss. I loathed Harry Potter. Book? Movie? Toy? Board game? Costume?	11	ed6yzaq
Man you'd be shocked to know some women still remain passive even when married.	26	ed7agsa
A quartet of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and Ox would be lovely.	8	edw6p87
This sub is filled with bitterness.	9	ed0rhfm
You should see a therapist if it‘s affecting your life or your mental health that much.	5	ed7hgxg
Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can’t afford to watch anymore of them.	14	edp1yr9
I almost hit the arrow in the screenshot	9	ee61ofa
I wish I didn’t fall for my ex. He is not a beautiful person. He is a monster.	8	eetcoae
America.... I have done goofed!	24	edvh5n2
Brother I desire your honey	8	eesdbnm
This is a terrible idea	14	eea9xxx
Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.	14	efesqfz
I thought he was trolling oops	12	ee8sgaw
So glad they had the clip of the dog getting up at the end. I was super worried.	23	eei2905
Your uncle sounds fun. RIP indeed	16	eefvuvg
"You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."	14	ef46ecg
nah man im just shook and dead™️	26	ee0wdfl
Benzos do not help anxiety long term. they make it worse	11	ee2w7cg
Can I start getting excited for [NAME] yet	13	eeqqrvv
Now I see why it takes me 30 minutes extra to get home if I miss an exit.	9	edffl0c
Never thought I’d see a comrade here	26	eelkqnn
You got it!	13	ee8z2o3
I watched my team get deep dicked in the natty. I understand	9	eez3xwj
tobaccy is nasty	11	edldizp
Hence the apology note.	24	efd6khq
Yay!!!!! You’ve got this!!!!	13	eeyv22z
I almost forgot about you for a minute	22	eeieuyo
Sorry, but you probably do given the AVers do have a limited literary skills at the best of times.	24	ee6sids
I've tried a whole lot of things, nothing has worked.	9	ed13s43
This is the stupidest thing to get excited over (but I am)	13	efebknb
Oh cool, the new sign is up :) 	13	eecb135
I have an idea. Hear me out in this. Maybe we shouldn’t get upset about [NAME] until.... they...sign... elsewhere? Too radical?	22	edj5eqp
It kind of surprised us how much of a feeling of control it gave us.	26	eerzzfl
Dont worry. I'll help you.	5	ed035o9
Do all you can. Really everything is put in perspective, my work seems very unimportant right now. 	22	eeiov4c
first time all season im kind of not thrilled with [NAME] post game talk. I wish he would have addressed the PP.	8	edx7z3n
I wish they would just let us stream their music. I have all their albums but every iPhone I get I have to redo the entire library 😴😴	8	efdvha7
I don't just cringe, I feel literal embarrassment for anyone who has watched it.	12	ef49a7u
We are usually way worse in the 3rd tbf	9	ef520o7
To be fair, it is worse than staying in the EU, but good grief it's better than a no deal.	11	efbczmc
Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food	11	ee6hipa
>Cause they almost never hit anything. Very inaccurate. The benefit of fighting against a largely untrained adversary.	9	ef6c027
Oh, how I miss real spicy Chinese food. Day after, not so much.	26	ee8ccls
terrifying every time.	14	ef7r8is
I mean this in the least creepy way possible, tell me how it works out NO DETAILS PLEASE GOD NO	14	edqs4tt
This sounds amazing!	13	eeg3e3m
[NAME] was such a nasty POS. In his dirty wifebeaters with his malt liquor. “Men have needs...” He disgusts me.	11	eezsisy
Are you ok?	5	ee7d669
Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy	19	eep9db2
Thats awful, I'm so sorry for your loss	11	ee5iv3l
Happy cake day!!!	26	ee9q98r
I want this poster so bad.	8	eee2eqw
I'm most amazed by implicit suggestion that you still aren't showing any signs. i mean coming out should be sign enough right?	26	ed9ijpj
Yeah but you're not anymore I'm afraid.	14	edi4n6c
Right? That's news to me. I'll be excited when that happens, I wonder how that works.	13	ef3kawg
I don’t like [NAME] all that much, but that dude seems cool. I hope it hits a goofy dark line like [NAME] or [NAME] tho.	8	ee5seud
That movie really scared me when I was a kid.	14	edq6shj
Save a spot for me! I'll bring the rainbow penis shaped bags of penis shaped rainbow glitter!	13	eevxjap
I know you will make her proud. always appreciate your parents they won’t be here forever ❤️	5	ee92gd9
I wish the camera showed the cops reactions and faces when it didn't work	8	edla8k6
Happy looking fella ain’t he!	13	ed9nv8w
I think if you're sending and receiving texts longer than 10 words your marriage is doomed.	22	eep9n9g
I’m surprised nyxl hasn’t done that with their overloaded dps roster, but a possible upcoming import limit might be the issue	26	ee04wl5
Heres some well wishes to you staying up	5	eeigkbc
I wish. But sadly my job relies on other people so I just can't be the sole person	8	edhqxzf
The second overall pick is pretty embarrassing	12	ed5v556
Looks like I’m getting an incredibles suit designed for me in this class	13	eeowdpm
"Yeah, the golden nugget is ""Get over yourself and let him back in, he made a (small) mistake"""	5	ed5ibme
This isn't normal. If he's this way now, can you imagine later on? Time to move on girl. 	5	eeqi1ce
She would be crying because your showing yiu truly care. Its up to you buddy but tears of joy are good.	5	ed9bmgm
Exactly my goals as well. Let's make it a great year.	13	ed0p5il
random fact: my pokerstars avatar has been a picture of that very hit since that night of 2006 LOL you could say that this hit was... pretty mint	21	eez08l2
[NAME] bless [NAME] for unlocking Michigan's Anger-Swag.	5	efbzrdd
The second half of the game was a big disappointment for me. I really wish they kept the family around for much longer.	9	ef80ro5
Fear mongering.	14	ee1vtaq
[NAME] ain't all that. Sorry.	24	ef1gdya
hahaha. I was/am honestly surprised that is the only time I've heard of a parent calling a rapid.	26	efe8aby
You sound scared	14	edjwnfo
What's with the buying porn thing? I missed out on it	9	eegjywd
I’m feeling very excited !	13	eest05t
I don't know what's more embarrassing, the fact I watch the show or own a Roku TV.	12	eczx4ck
Yet, his recoveries on attacks are abysmal.	9	efauuti
You sound like someone who doesnt know what ironic humour is.	9	ed6nzve
Wow, automated can collection is news in 2019? Literally have done this for a decade minimum...	13	ed4s6jh
I know, i read that previous post. Im just worried about your parrot getting injured because of that woman :/	5	efee9py
I went there once and was like “yeah neat I guess” around the same time. Totally forgot about it until I saw the pic of the door	11	edvfn8h
The fact that she told you your sex life is over is insane to me.	26	ef802kc
Yes, thankfully it has never happened to me, asking out of (morbid) curiosity.	23	eejlu2l
No problem, it warms my heart to help slower people understand things.	5	ee5azn8

But he was so *hurt* when [NAME] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin.	9	ed8dwho

Wow, never knew about [NAME] and I thought I was well-read!	26	eebv8gy
The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was.	26	edukq6a

You're going to seriously regret this in a few years.	24	ed4o321

That's why imo [NAME] death is better.	16	eff9qjb

He has the maturity of a 2 year old and you are right...ugly in his soul.	11	edexh8p
>it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.	11	eeanz9f
seems odd, when you guys consume much more pizza, I would say overall than us	12	eeomrth

Absolutely ripping for that show. Really excited to see what they play!	13	eczl3ai
Definitely surprised we took out [NAME] there. We needed to finish the quarter strong and it went straight to shit when he left.	26	edy6yrf

Haha I don't know where you are, but I feel you	5	eeyjamp
That is awesome to know. I’m moving back to Chicago in August.	13	eehe78m
It's the great irony of The Resistance©. It's hard to be a rebel when most of the powerful institutions of the country are on your side	22	ed5sdlc
In that case, I’m appalled. 	14	ee8d1if

I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries	14	edj3og4
I could go, but honestly, it is the worst place on earth. I have 0 desire to do it.	11	ed1sjv8
I would meet up in a public place first. Invite her to a bar within walking distance of your place and assess. Safety first.	5	eehyp6x
I wish could do what you do. It has been my dream. Im jealous	8	ef5d1hd
That sounds terrible.	14	ed1q102

The absolute worst!	11	eddbxp3
After 6 weeks, anything becomes a habit I hear. 	22	edtuay9
Annnnd that's too far. I think you should go home and rethink your life.	5	eczwosz
Drives me crazy.	13	ee5cn0s
Oh, I saw it. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt to see if he wound up saying the quiet part out loud.	5	ee74eiu
Could have been worse if a piece of metal exploded into him instead harmlessly on the beach	11	ef67zpf
Sounds magical!	13	edi4y8m
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.	14	ef2asqu
One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen	11	eewy24f
Oh, it’s you again. Here: 	26	eecqi4h
Lifesite “News” doxxed him. That website is just pure hatred distilled, it’s disgusting.	11	eewoojk

Of course it bothers you. She just admitted that something inconsequential to your relationship would be a dealbreaker.	9	edgn21p
Pm me I'd love to buy it from you if you have any spare!	8	ef80ln0
The shocking thing about this all is that she seems to be British born. I'd expect this from immigrants, not those born in the UK.	26	ef4tec8

That hop/shuffle is scary	14	ee8as5c
nearly choked on my chicken breast	14	edl2c3q
Don't self-diagnose. Talk to a medical professional and check for known diseases that may cause depression (hashimoto's comes to mind).	5	edajj4g
Well now I think I was wrong	22	edwyofh
Exactly. It was The fact that everything happened and ended so suddenly that left me speechless.	26	edocc0q
Ok but what if you hire him into a management position. He makes women feel uncomfortable and a discrimination suit waiting to happen.	11	eeknrt3

[NAME] went form 4-12 to 11-5 when he switched teams. Coaching success does not necessarily regress with age. Athletic ability does. That's the difference.	22	edm1coz
I had to put Bird Box because it's the only direct to streaming movie I saw. I feel dirty.	11	edplrk1

It's my masterpiece.	21	eemtr6t
You realize legal investigations take a long time? [NAME] is a methodical professional and clearly several steps ahead of [NAME]. Be patient	22	eetk105
I'm sorry you're going through that, I wish I could help somehow :c.	24	ed27mdj
Good for you to get out of it!! seems like a nasty example of narc abuse. No contact!	5	edzdkc5

Before you get too excited remember the human Officer is there to help his doggy partner.	13	eendezn
Chasing thoughts and storing tension in your hands is how you distract yourself from feeling social tension and empathy. You need to allow yourself to feel these feelings.	5	ed6eaf9
You do realize that this is the sub for non-Trump supporters to come ask questions to [NAME] supporters. The OPs are all non-Trump supporters	22	eczbupd
Of course I love myself because I'm awesome.	21	eera5at
Incels can't even get a pleb thing called sex. Sex is for [NAME] apparently.	9	eeoz31r
We knows mumps immunity wanes; is it possible for measles immunity to do the same thing? I'm kinda scared to try Googling it too.	14	ed4o2hd
It's interesting to watch what happens to people when they find out how easy it is to get on TV and get paid.	13	edpsxhp
Live your life well. Let them figure it out for themselves.	5	eeye6cz
Both. I have a feeling that broth was ruined a long time ago, in a footballers bedroom not so far away.	22	edwlnjy
I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I’ll hate them like the rest. 	9	eee4s5s
At least this makes me feel better about not being photogenic. It’s the cameras fault!	23	edhvwaz
You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election.	5	eeqeoki

Wow - it would be great to have an AMA about what you learned compared to the truth. How recently were you in seminary or at BYU?	13	edo7blw
So many players from the current crop are going to end up on 300+ games, crazy to think how exclusive it was not too long ago	13	eetlfxl
Yeah I cannot either on mobile, same with enough internet. Thoroughly disappointing.	9	eei6nwr

oh my good	26	eeyjjcb
I have these high powered magnets...	21	ed2b30u
I was actually thinking about that during tonight's episode. I don't think the show would last long without [NAME] though.	22	eeo40ko
If you are feeding your two year old 1200 calories then you are fattening them up for the stew lady.	22	efh96r0
But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad.	11	edcdbo8

I suspect that it's harder to combat sexism in academia because racialized theories have fallen out of favor but sexist ones are still all the rage.	22	ed2d7td
I want to see the human equivalent to how happy this dog is	8	ed74b9g
sounds good, take care & stay safe loves💕	5	effxjq8

My darling, have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet? We are very worried. 	14	eeubpbz
Clearly, he had a bad Wednesday practice…	9	edl2fng
already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame.	9	eebm0lx
Come on, New Day! Make it finally finally happen, [NAME]!	13	ef4th2g
I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My mom does the same anytime she loses something. She accuses people of stealing whatever she lost.	24	ef4g64h
Sleep tight [NAME]!	5	edrcrhb
They wanted all the shows to be based in New York. Seems like a weird reason but that’s what [NAME] said	8	eeavtgp
That's disgusting. Apt.	11	ed5030i
Unbelievable that we didn’t sign him Also, we could’ve potentially signed [NAME] the window we signed [NAME]. Kill me.	26	edwbg1r
I watch his YouTube stuff. It's gross!	11	ef4gpld
Damn this sounds like a former friend of mine. She doesn’t get instant validation on things and flips out. Cut negative people out OP.	5	ed60b0e
You're setting the bar awfully low for yourself.	9	eegqb4m
Not related, but now I wonder how Delta would have done on the hair ball challenge	26	ed4s954

Whew. I'm safe then.	23	edmzsh6
I apologize for doubting you.	24	eeeky7q
Seriously? I couldn't even remember the dude's name until about halfway through the season honestly.	26	edkxs5c
I need to hear more stories like this. I've only heard horror stories of the pain with the surgery as an adult.	8	ee8pk8u
I’m sorry to hear that. When do you graduate?	24	ed1tq0s
They can't even really articulate what has been so bad since [NAME] took office.	12	edry16j
You're just upset because it accurately highlights the absurdity of the minimum wage.	9	eessgob
JAEGER CALM DOWN!	5	ed5vbdp
I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .	11	ednkli8
Yes but that's largely changed in much of the US (the coasts at least). Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it	26	edr298t
To be fair [NAME] and Unite were both cleared of wrongdoing.	22	edmh4it
Imagine thinking this comment was ok to post. Shame on you.	11	eeaau1f
I'd say the bigger potential problem is getting reported for public indecency, that goes on your criminal record.	14	eek626j
Oh no, my secret identity as a neurosurgeon/entomologist/radiologist/anesthetist/dentist has been discovered! I knew I should have given less detailed medical advice online! D: 	26	ef9cbbq
That I was unbreakable. It took some serious injuries in “high school” until I realized that I wasn’t.	22	eel5yes
Can’t wait to see this monster perp walk.	13	eer5aaa
Yeah maybe I over indulged as a young lad!	22	ef6vwlx
Wow. The Miami police! [NAME]! So much to this documentary.	13	efghc9h
Sometimes, I am amazed that they are able to fit into a car.	26	ee8p1vx
Tkachuk - Pageau - Stone is going to be our second line. Absolutely filthy.	11	ed9bbey
Papaoutai still leaves me bald.	9	edldyc5
Hey fuck-o I've broken plenty of rules I just have the decency to be ashamed of it.	12	ee21ry9
Holy crap. I wish real life looked this good...	8	edoysf5
A derogatory term.	11	eeyg6l2
Wow she still hasn't helped even though you recognize it?	26	eecj7l9
What's he whining about, I am only 52 and stuck on SSI now and only getting 1400.00	9	ed5ig9y
PD would probably get us [NAME] so we would all get pump faked until you realize he got the wrong one. Exhibit A [NAME] -_-	9	efh527z
Sure. But [NAME] was well aware of the problem re GST and didn’t mention it until he was filling in his pension application.	22	ee9xcuc
About every direction, down gives you the same problem as up and every other direction is less effective to escape.	5	efdbvut
Wow I had no idea all of this transpired. Crazy!	26	efb623v
When I drove refers I was always afraid this would happen to me. I always shut my doors I'm just a worrier	14	eepmbs2
He was afraid of flying	14	eex7622
Not really someone I despise, but definitely someone I was ashamed of.	12	ee3dzzd
Oh my *FUCKING* **GOD**!!	26	edtwzpb
Dude couldn’t see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?!	26	ed4q6bu
That is disgusting. And not one parent thought that was a *bit* inappropriate? smh	11	edn1z4o

When I was a kid and it was really interesting how you could do to make you believe that you need to go back to sleep.	22	edqd86c
I never said anything. I’m just cynical that change can happen when there is so much money on the line. Decisions are bought not made.	22	ee9rd8y
Mate, you’re a [NAME]. If it wasn’t for us you wouldn’t even exist. 	22	ee1xcts
This is my dream deal as well please basketball gods make it happen	8	ef71j5o

My family never cared enough, I wish they did...	9	eebzgi2
The name he asked if I was, was some foreign name. It was so far off from my actual name I thought it was a joke at first 	22	eehdg3g
Yeah yeah science, but I never said anything about meeting forcing him. That's disgusts me.	11	ee9u4ur
I did not know those were a thing. I need to get one for my pain meds.	22	eewa3id
I am not having a great day either. Sending good vibes, hope you feel better :)	5	edijjci
OMG make it I want to be in on the ground floor of something #INVEST INVEST	13	ee90oaa
Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.	11	eefbfql
